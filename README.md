# Port size optimization
In this project we explore the possibility to optimize for large ports between coils (black on figure below) of a stellarator. 
The goal is to design stellarator with easy access to the plasma-facing components, thereby improving the machine maintenance capabilities. 
We consider two access direction, either a vertical access (green on figure below), or a horizontal access (red on figure below). 
The approach can be generalized to any access direction, but we do not explore it here for now.

To run the scipts in this repository, the `accessibility` branch of `simsopt` has to be used. See [this link](https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/simsopt/tree/accessibility).
