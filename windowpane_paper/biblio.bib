  abstract = {In the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator, the vacuum rotational transform, ι , has a flat radial profile and does not cross any major rational resonance. Nevertheless, during plasma operation the ι ‐profile can be strongly modified by electron cyclotron current drive in such a way that the resulting ι -profile passes through low-order rational values, and this can trigger magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) events. Indeed, W7-X plasmas are sometimes subject to repetitive collapses of core confinement, which can be observed regardless of the direction in which the EC current is driven. Even though the origin of these MHD instabilities is under investigation, the crashes may be connected to the formation of magnetic islands and magnetic reconnection. In the present work, we try to shed light on the dynamics of different events happening during the course of sawtooth cycles in W7-X by proposing a model that combines a slow current diffusion with a recipe for fast relaxation that conserves the corresponding helical flux (Kadomtsev 1975 Fiz. Plazmy 1 710–15). We also propose a simple model based on Taylor relaxation (Taylor 1974 Phys. Rev. Lett. 33 1139), (Taylor 1986 Rev. Mod. Phys. 58 741) to predict the nonlinear redistribution of plasma current caused by the largest of the observed events.},

  abstract = {The ongoing development of electromagnets based on high temperature superconductors has led to the conceptual exploration of high-magnetic-field fusion reactors of the tokamak type, operating at on-axis fields above 10 T. In this work we explore the consequences of the potential future availability of high-field three-dimensional electromagnets on the physics design point of a stellarator reactor. We find that, when an increase in the magnetic field strength B is used to maximally reduce the device linear size R ∼ B −4/3 (with otherwise fixed magnetic geometry), the physics design point is largely independent of the chosen field strength/device size. A similar degree of optimization is to be imposed on the magnetohydrodynamic, transport and fast ion confinement properties of the magnetic configuration of that family of reactor design points. Additionally, we show that the family shares an invariant operation map of fusion power output as a function of the auxiliary power and relative density variation. The effects of magnetic field over-engineering and the R(B) scaling of design points with constant neutron wall loading are also inspected. In this study we use geometric parameters characteristic of the helical axis advanced stellarator reactor, but most results apply to other stellarator configurations.},

The nested magnetic surfaces in W7-X are created by a system of 3-D toroidally discrete coils, providing both toroidal and poloidal field components, and designed with the aim to create optimum equilibrium properties. The optimization criteria included the high quality of vacuum magnetic surfaces, good finite beta equilibrium and MHD-stability properties as well as a substantial reduction of the neoclassical transport and bootstrap current in comparison to classical stellarators. Equilibrium calculations, devoted to the analysis of the experiment programs dedicated to measure the bootstrap current, were performed with help of the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code, available as Wendelstein 7-X web service. Pressure profiles based on experimental data served as an input for calculations. The mapping of measurements using pre-calculated equilibria for different beta values has been analyzed. A comparison with reconstruction results obtained by means of the Minerva Framework, considering only experimental data of magnetics measurements, and the V3FIT code is presented.},

  abstract = {The shape gradient quantifies the change in some figure of merit resulting from differential perturbations to a shape. Shape gradients can be applied to gradient-based optimization, sensitivity analysis and tolerance calculation. An efficient method for computing the shape gradient for toroidal three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria is presented. The method is based on the self-adjoint property of the equations for driven perturbations of MHD equilibria and is similar to the Onsager symmetry of transport coefficients. Two versions of the shape gradient are considered. One describes the change in a figure of merit due to an arbitrary displacement of the outer flux surface; the other describes the change in the figure of merit due to the displacement of a coil. The method is implemented for several example figures of merit and compared with direct calculation of the shape gradient. In these examples the adjoint method reduces the number of equilibrium computations by factors of    \$O(N)\$   , where    \$N\$   is the number of parameters used to describe the outer flux surface or coil shapes.},

For each of these issues potential solutions have been identified and activity plans have been defined for the associated developments and assessments. Two of these affect in particular the integrated design of the DEMO machine, namely (i) and (iv). These are introduced and discussed in this article providing a summary of identified risks, requirements, and solution concepts.

  abstract = {The development of a remote maintenance concept to replace DEMO in-vessel components after completion of their lifecycle or in case of failure is fundamental to the successful implementation of the EU fusion roadmap. The replacement of the hot breeding blanket (BB), by far the largest in-vessel component, at the end of its lifecycle is particularly important. This includes the removal from the reactor, the transport to the active maintenance facility (AMF) where the BB is decontaminated and prepared for storage as radioactive waste and the preparation and installation of the new BB. Significant effort is made to control and minimize the spread of contamination. All operations are therefore carried out in sealed rooms and corridors. The high mass of the BB segments requires all remote handling equipment to be capable of handling high payloads of more than 100 tons. It must also operate within tight space and based on impaired feedback from control sensors in the radioactive environment. At the same time, it must be highly reliable in accordance with nuclear requirements and be recoverable in case of failure. Some concepts of BB lifting devices were investigated in the past [1] (Keep et~al., 2017), but were discontinued due to insufficient payload capacity. Thus, the vertical maintenance of the BB was identified as one of DEMO's key design integration issues since failure to develop a feasible concept would potentially require major changes to the tokamak architecture [2] (Bachmann et~al., 2020). A new study had been initiated with a focus on structural integrity and efficient load transfer from the BB through the RH equipment to the VV upper port. A concept of the BB transfer cask and the BB transporter resulting from this study is presented in this article together with a conceptual study of the layout of the tokamak building and the AMF. Studies of alternative concepts for in-vessel maintenance are conducted in parallel but will not be described here.},

Our focus is mainly on the HDI and its evolution and unsolved technical issues. Was the HDI successful as an alternative? Given that the established goal was to provide an alternative index to the unidimensional and income centred previous indicators, HDI represents indeed advancement, both in terms of the characterisation of the multidimensional nature of development and in terms of its refined theoretical basis. On the other hand, arguments claiming the introduction of a completely new paradigm, showing a change from the concentration on means towards the promotion of human ends, are far from being settled. The claim that HDI is a capability measure, considered the most basic human capabilities, also remains elusive.},

Toroidal currents are expressed in the framework of the MRxMHD theory, exhibiting spatial separation between pressure driven and externally driven currents. Additionally, analytical force balance derivatives at constant toroidal current are deployed in order to maintain SPEC's advantageous speed. The newly implemented capability is verified in screw pinch and classical stellarator geometries, and is applied to obtain the equilibrium \$\textbackslash beta\$ -limit of a classical stellarator without net toroidal currents. This new capability opens the possibility to study the effect of toroidal current on three-dimensional equilibria with the SPEC code.},

  abstract = {Good magnetic surfaces, as opposed to magnetic islands and chaotic field lines, are generally desirable for stellarators. In previous work, Landreman et al. [Phys. of Plasmas 28, 092505 (2021)] showed that equilibria computed by the Stepped-Pressure Equilibrium Code (SPEC) [Hudson et al., Phys. Plasmas 19, 112502 (2012)] could be optimized for good magnetic surfaces in vacuum. In this paper, we build upon their work to show the first finite- β, fixed-, and free-boundary optimization of SPEC equilibria for good magnetic surfaces. The objective function is constructed with the Greene's residue of selected rational surfaces, and the optimization is driven by the SIMSOPT framework [Landreman et al., J. Open Source Software 6, 3525 (2021)]. We show that the size of magnetic islands and the consequent regions occupied by chaotic field lines can be minimized in a classical stellarator geometry (rotating ellipse) by optimizing either the injected toroidal current profile, the shape of a perfectly conducting wall surrounding the plasma (fixed-boundary case), or the vacuum field produced by the coils (free-boundary case). This work shows that SPEC can be used as an equilibrium code both in a two-step or single-step stellarator optimization loop.},

  abstract = {While it is important to design stellarators with high magnetohydrodynamic stability ��β\textbackslash beta-limit, it is also crucial to ensure that good magnetic surfaces exist in a large range of ��β\textbackslash beta values. As ��β\textbackslash beta increases, pressure-driven currents perturb the vacuum magnetic field and often lead to the emergence of magnetic field line chaos, which can worsen the confinement and is the cause of another kind of ��β\textbackslash beta-limit, the so-called equilibrium ��β\textbackslash beta-limit. In this paper, we explore numerically the dependence of the equilibrium ��β\textbackslash beta-limit on the bootstrap current strength in a classical stellarator geometry using the stepped pressure equilibrium code. We develop a diagnostic to determine whether or not magnetic islands are expected to participate significantly to radial transport, and we build an analytical model to predict the expected equilibrium ��β\textbackslash beta-limit, which recovers the main features of the numerical results. This research opens the possibility to include additional targets in stellarator optimization functions, provides additional understanding on the existence of magnetic surfaces at large ��β\textbackslash beta, and is a step forward in the understanding of the equilibrium ��β\textbackslash beta-limit.},

  abstract = {Research on magnetic confinement of high-temperature plasmas has the ultimate goal of harnessing nuclear fusion for the production of electricity. Although the tokamak1 is the leading toroidal magnetic-confinement concept, it is not without shortcomings and the fusion community has therefore also pursued alternative concepts such as the stellarator. Unlike axisymmetric tokamaks, stellarators possess a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field geometry. The availability of this additional dimension opens up an extensive configuration space for computational optimization of both the field geometry itself and the current-carrying coils that produce it. Such an optimization was undertaken in designing Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)2, a large helical-axis advanced stellarator (HELIAS), which began operation in 2015 at Greifswald, Germany. A major drawback of 3D magnetic field geometry, however, is that it introduces a strong temperature dependence into the stellarator’s non-turbulent ‘neoclassical’ energy transport. Indeed, such energy losses will become prohibitive in high-temperature reactor plasmas unless a strong reduction of the geometrical factor associated with this transport can be achieved; such a reduction was therefore a principal goal of the design of W7-X. In spite of the modest heating power currently available, W7-X has already been able to achieve high-temperature plasma conditions during its 2017 and 2018 experimental campaigns, producing record values of the fusion triple product for such stellarator plasmas3,4. The triple product of plasma density, ion temperature and energy confinement time is used in fusion research as a figure of merit, as it must attain a certain threshold value before net-energy-producing operation of a reactor becomes possible1,5. Here we demonstrate that such record values provide evidence for reduced neoclassical energy transport in W7-X, as the plasma profiles that produced these results could not have been obtained in stellarators lacking a comparably high level of neoclassical optimization.},

  abstract = {A fully three‐dimensional spectral code has been developed and implemented. It computes three‐dimensional equilibria using the variational approach, by minimizing the potential energy subject to appropriate constraints. A second minimization, with an additional constraint, is used to examine the stability of solutions. The magnetic field representation allows for non‐nested flux surfaces. Thus it can be used to study solutions with islands and variation of the potential energy with respect to topology changes. A spectral representation in the toroidal and poloidal angles, coupled with a special choice of collocation points in the radial direction results in greatly enhanced resolution. A fast iterative method was developed, with the number of iterations required for convergence independent of the mesh size. Residuals converge exponentially to the round‐off error, allowing the potential energy to be computed to the eight‐digit accuracy required for nonlinear stability analysis. A small amount of artificial viscosity may be needed for convergence in cases where low‐order resonances are present in the plasma region. Numerical results show convergence to known axially symmetric equilibrium solutions, as well as close agreement with eigenvalue calculations in helically symmetric stellarator configurations. Solutions exhibiting island formations are found to have lower potential energy than that of the nearby nested case. Internal modes are found to localize inside the resonant surface, with the eigenfunction having sharp gradients at the resonant surface. Copyright © 1988 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company},

The isolated effect of this modification on the dynamics of turbulence is studied by means of electrostatic simulations. We find that turbulence is reduced when the profiles relaxed by the AM are used, with respect to the simulation where the unperturbed profiles are used. This is an example of indirect interaction of EPs and turbulence. First, an analytic magnetic equilibrium with circular concentric flux surfaces is considered as a simplified example for this study.

  abstract = {The Human Development Index (HDI) is one of the most widely used composite indicators of socio-economic development. However, the HDI is at the cross-roads. In order to retain its flagship role in the development arena, many scholars have called from the HDI to reinvent itself by adding sustainability dimensions. The aim of this paper is to introduce the Sustainable Human Development Index (SHDI), based on Multidimensional Synthesis of Indicators (MSI) – a new class of indexes that can be used for monitoring Sustainable Human Development (SHD). The approach we propose aims to address two primary issues regarding the HDI. The first issue involves the integration into the SHDI of two important sustainability-related dimensions that are missing in the HDI; namely, the environment and freedom (defined here in terms of political rights and civil liberties). The second issue focuses on the method of aggregation using the new class of indexes proposed. We aim to expand on the three standard HDI dimensions while avoiding problems associated with the geometric mean that tends to collapse to zero. In doing so, we manage to retain the same theoretical intuitions of the post-2010 HDI approach, i.e. to penalize the heterogeneity of outcomes. Moreover, we rely on the flexibility of the MSI approach to develop another index, the Environmentally-centered Sustainable Human Development Index (ESHDI), which puts the environmental dimension at the core of the analysis. In the first part of the paper we introduce the theoretical debate on the multidimensionality of the HDI, and consider the two new dimensions of sustainability, as well as the MSI aggregation approach. In the second part, the SHDI and the ESHDI are introduced, tested through a simulation analysis, and are compared with the HDI geometric mean using 2013 data. The simulations and the results of the empirical analysis show how the new class of indexes provide a more flexible approach to the procedure of aggregation, especially when the number of dimensions increases and/or when there is the need to stress the importance of one or more dimensions. The introduction of the two environmental and freedom sustainability dimensions greatly increases the potential of the HDI to address the SHD paradigm by capturing two core issues for the humanity and its common future.},

In this study, we show how multi-objective optimization (MOO) can be used to investigate trade-offs and develop insight into the role of design parameters. We discuss the basics of MOO, as well as practical solution methods for solving MOO problems. We apply these methods to bring insight into the selection of two common design parameters: the aspect ratio of an ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium and the total length of the electromagnetic coils.},

  abstract = {The physics of non-axisymmetry is a far more important topic in the theory of toroidal fusion plasmas than might be expected. (1) Even a small toroidal asymmetry in the magnetic field strength, δ ≡ ∂ ln B/∂φ ∼ 10-4, can cause an unacceptable degradation in performance. (2) Nevertheless, asymmetries - even large asymmetries δ ∼ 1 - can give beneficial plasma control and circumvent issues, such as magnetic-configuration maintenance and plasma disruptions, that make axisymmetric fusion devices problematic. Viewed from prospectives that are adequate for designing and studying axisymmetric plasmas, the physics of non-axisymmetric plasmas appears dauntingly difficult. Remarkably, Maxwell's equations provide such strong constraints on the physics of toroidal fusion plasmas that even a black-box model of a plasma answers many important questions. Kinetic theory and non-equilibrium thermodynamics provide further, but more nuanced, constraints. This paper is organized so these constraints can be used as a basis for the innovations and for the extrapolations that are required to go from existing experiments to fusion systems. Outlines are given of a number of calculations that would be of great importance to ITER and to the overall fusion program and that could be carried out now with limited resources.},

  abstract = {The speed with which fusion can be developed is important for the mitigation of the physical and political risks associated with the continual increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Remarkably, a stellarator demonstration reactor (DEMO) could be based more reliably on the empirical information available now than a tokamak DEMO on the empirical information that ITER is likely to provide over the next twenty years. Waiting imposes major risks on society and is unnecessary. Readiness is sufficiently revolutionary that many will assume that it can be dismissed without thought. But, those who are willing to read and to think will find the arguments simple and self-evident. The paper explains not only how stellarators are better positioned now than any other concept for a fast path to fusion but also areas in which further improvements can be quickly made to stellarators through computational design.},

  abstract = {This paper is focused on three points: (1) overcoming obstacles to tokamak power plants may require a configuration modification as large as that of a stellarator. (2) The demonstrated reliability of the computational design of stellarators should change fusion strategy. (3) Deployment of carbon-free energy sources is mandated by the thirty-year doubling of carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon-free energy options must be developed and fully deployed within a few doubling times. Unit size and cost of electricity are only relevant in comparison to alternative worldwide energy solutions. Intermittency, site specificity, waste management, and nuclear proliferation make fusion attractive as the basis for a carbon-free energy system compared to the alternatives. Nonetheless, fusion is not an option for deployment until a power plant has successfully operated. A critical element in a minimal time and risk program is the use of computational design as opposed to just extrapolation. Only the stellarator has an empirical demonstration of the reliable computational design through large changes in configuration properties and scale. The computational design of stellarators should proceed while the inventions necessary for a more tokamak-like power plant are sought. The cost of computational design is extremely small, but adequate time is required for the development of ideas that maximize attractiveness and minimize risk. Rapid power-plant construction without many intermediate steps may seem risky, but the price is small compared to the cost of trillions of dollars for each year’s delay in addressing carbon-dioxide emissions.},

  abstract = {The operation of ITER will require reliable simulations in order to avoid major damage to the device from disruptions. Disruptions are the sudden breakup of magnetic surfaces across the plasma volume—a fast magnetic reconnection. This reconnection can be caused by the growth of perturbations outside of the plasma core causing an ideal perturbation to the core. This causes an increasing ratio of the maximum to the minimum separation, Δmax/Δmin, between neighboring magnetic surfaces. Magnetic reconnection becomes a dominant process when magnetic field lines can quickly interchange connections over a spatial scale ar. This occurs when Δmax/Δmin≳ar/Δd, where Δd is the scale over which non-ideal effects make magnetic field lines indistinguishable. Traditional reconnection theory is fundamentally different. It is a study of the steady-state cancelation of oppositely directed magnetic field components across a thin layer. During more than sixty years, mathematical implications of Faraday's law have been derived that clarify and constrain the physics of fast magnetic reconnection. These are reviewed because they are not commonly known but are needed to understand and to place in context how an ideal magnetic evolution can cause reconnection to quickly become a dominant process no matter how small Δd/ar may be.},

Fast ions are generated by a miniaturized lithium 6+ ion source with energies up to 1 keV, and are detected using a double-gridded energy analyser mounted on a two-dimensional movable system in the poloidal cross-section. The signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced by applying a modulated biasing voltage to the fast ion source and using a synchronous detection scheme. An analogue lock-in amplifier has been developed, which allows removing the capacitive noise associated with the voltage modulation. We characterize vertical and radial transport of the fast ions, which is associated with the plasma turbulence. Initial experimental results show good agreement with numerical simulations of the fast ion transport in a global fluid simulation of the TORPEX plasma.},

Saddle coils were located within separate enclosures and configured to reconstitute changes in the magnetic fields caused by straightening the MC back legs. A follow on lab directed research study looked to further improve stellarator maintenance by considering higher aspect ratio plasmas along with improving the MC defining metrics by adding engineering maintenance requirements to the physics code used in defining the modular coil winding configuration. The physics design code (COILOPT) was upgraded to provide coil solutions with straightened MC back legs and to receive inputs of engineering constraints on the MC surface geometry and winding centers. Several improvements and extensions of COILOPT++ were made which include: the ability to target coil penalties and freeze coil geometry for individual coils; adding torsion constraints on the geometry of the space curve defining the MC winding; allowing freedom to straighten MC back legs over asymmetric distances above and below the outboard midplane; the inclusion of nested saddles with enforced minimum coil-to-coil separation distances and adding the ability to accept coil winding surface geometry from Pro- E. These changes along with a number of other features have substantially improved our ability to achieve better self-consistency between engineering maintenance requirements and plasma surface reconstructions with targeted physics. Using the new COILOPT++ code, a first pass design of an improved maintenance stellarator device has been developed. The code details and the ensuing device design will be presented.},

We say a magnetic field is isodrastic if guiding centres make no transitions between classes of motion. Therefore, this is an important ideal for enhancing confinement. First, we present a weak formulation, based on the longitudinal adiabatic invariant, generalising omnigenity. To demonstrate that isodrasticity is strictly more general than omnigenity, we construct weakly isodrastic mirror fields that are not omnigenous. Then we present a strong formulation that is exact for guiding-centre motion. We develop a first-order treatment of the strong version via a Melnikov function and show that it recovers the weak version. The theory provides quantification of deviations from isodrasticity that can be used as objective functions in optimal design. The theory is illustrated on some simple examples.},

We take advantage of a symplectic integrator allowing us to make long-time simulations. First considering an idealized magnetic configuration, we add a non generic perturbation corresponding to a magnetic ripple, breaking one of the invariant of the motion. Chaotic motion is then observed and opens questions about the link between chaos of magnetic field lines and chaos of particle trajectories. Second, we return to a axi-symmetric configuration and tune the safety factor (magnetic configuration) in order to recover chaotic motion. In this last setting with two constants of the motion, the presence of chaos implies that no third global constant exists, we highlight this fact by looking at variations of the first order of the magnetic moment in this chaotic setting. We are facing a mixed phase space with both regular and chaotic regions and point out the difficulties in performing a global reduction such as gyrokinetics.},

  abstract = {Coil complexity is a critical consideration in stellarator design. The traditional two-step optimization approach, in which the plasma boundary is optimized for physics properties and the coils are subsequently optimized to be consistent with this boundary, can result in plasma shapes which cannot be produced with sufficiently simple coils. To address this challenge, we propose a method to incorporate considerations of coil complexity in the optimization of the plasma boundary. Coil complexity metrics are computed from the current potential solution obtained with the REGCOIL code (Landreman, Nucl. Fusion, vol. 57, 2017, 046003). While such metrics have previously been included in derivative-free fixed-boundary optimization (Drevlak et al., Nucl. Fusion, vol. 59, 2018, 016010), we compute the local sensitivity of these metrics with respect to perturbations of the plasma boundary using the shape gradient (Landreman \& Paul, Nucl. Fusion, vol. 58, 2018, 076023). We extend REGCOIL to compute derivatives of these metrics with respect to parameters describing the plasma boundary. In keeping with previous research on winding surface optimization (Paul et al., Nucl. Fusion, vol. 58, 2018, 076015), the shape derivatives are computed with a discrete adjoint method. In contrast with the previous work, derivatives are computed with respect to the plasma surface parameters rather than the winding surface parameters. To further reduce the resolution required to compute the shape gradient, we present a more efficient representation of the plasma surface which uses a single Fourier series to describe the radial distance from a coordinate axis and a spectrally condensed poloidal angle. This representation is advantageous over the standard cylindrical representation used in the VMEC code (Hirshman \& Whitson, Phys. Fluids, vol. 26, 1983, pp. 3553–3568), as it provides a uniquely defined poloidal angle, eliminating a null space in the optimization of the plasma surface. In comparison with previous spectral condensation methods (Hirshman \& Breslau, Phys. Plasmas, vol. 5, 1998, p. 2664), the modified poloidal angle is obtained algebraically rather than through the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. The resulting shape gradient highlights features of the plasma boundary that are consistent with simple coils and can be used to couple coil and fixed-boundary optimization.},

Far from the rational surfaces, a procedure based on linearization in the plasma pressure applies. This yields the solution in terms of δ-function currents at the surface. These currents are found by a nonlinear analysis valid in the vicinity of the island. The result is a set of coupled nonlinear equations determining the island widths. Scaling is found by using the approximation of nearly circular flux surfaces. The results indicate that for typical stellarators, which have a small ratio Łl o/m o of field line rotational transform to coil rotational transform, the island size in the low-β limit depends dramatically on whether a magnetic well is present. In this case, if a magnetic well is present, islands are insignificant; in contrast, if a magnetic hill is present, island overlap occurs for arbitrarily low pressure. © 1985 American Institute of Physics.},

This method of control is based on a localized control of chaos in Hamiltonian systems. The aim is to modify the perturbation (of order ε) locally by a small control term (of order ε2) which creates invariant tori acting as barriers to diffusion for Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom. The location of the invariant torus is enforced in the vicinity of the chosen target (at a distance of order ε due to the angle dependence). Given the importance of confinement in magnetic fusion devices, the method is applied to two examples with a loss of magnetic confinement. In the case of locked tearing modes, an invariant torus can be restored that aims at showing the current quench and therefore the generation of runaway electrons. In the second case, the method is applied to the control of stochastic boundaries allowing one to define a transport barrier within the stochastic boundary and therefore to monitor the volume of closed field lines. © 2006 IAEA, Vienna.},

Fusion 42, 614 (2002)] with the ion Grad-B drift directed toward the single-null divertor. Comparison with a reversed Grad-B drift case is also shown. It is found that there is a robust spontaneous co-current toroidal plasma rotation source in the far scrape-off plasma due to the wall sheath effect. As the edge pedestal width becomes narrower, the co-current rotation in the far scrape-off becomes weaker, but there appears a stronger co-current rotation in the pedestal top/shoulder from the X-point orbit loss effect, possibly providing a co-rotation boundary condition to the core plasma. Reversal of the magnetic field and plasma current brings down the overall co-rotation, especially in the far scrape-off plasma.},

A peculiar feature of this instability results in an irregular, or stochastic, motion of the system as if the latter were influenced by a random perturbation even though, in fact, the motion is governed by purely dynamical equations. The instability takes place generally for very special initial conditions (inside the so-called stochastic layers) which are, however, everywhere dense in the phase space of the systsm. The basic and simplest one of the models considered is that of a pendulum under an external periodic perturbation. This model represents the behavior of nonlinear oscillations near a resonance, including the phenomenon of the stochastic instability within the stochastic layer of resonance. All models are treated both analytically and numerically. Some general regulations concerning the stochastic instability are presented, including a general, semi-quantitative method-the overlap criterion-to estimate the conditions for this stochastic instability as well as its main characteristics. © 1979.},

Although the magnetic field strength B spectrum is dominated by a m/n = 1/0 component, the discrete filamentary coils trigger some small-amplitude symmetry-breaking components that can disturb the quasi-symmetry of B. Finite β causes the plasma column to shift outward in the absence of bootstrap current. With a self-consistent bootstrap current in the 1/v regime, the plasma becomes more elongated and more distorted in the horizontally elongated up-down symmetric cross section. At β ≃ 3.25\%, the plasma can be restored to its near-vacuum shape with the application of a vertical field with coil currents 20\% of those of the modular coils, but at the expense of a significant mirror component in the B-field spectrum. The bootstrap current causes the rotational transform ι profile to increase above the critical resonant value (ιc =1/2 for β ≥ 1.1\%) and combines with the Pfirsch-Schlüter current to destabilize a m/n = 2/1 external kink mode for β ≥ 1.8\%.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that the route to fusion power involves large devices of ITER scale or larger. However, we show, contrary to expectations, that for steady state tokamaks operating at fixed fractions of the density and beta limits, the fusion gain, Q fus , depends mainly on the absolute level of the fusion power and the energy confinement, and only weakly on the device size. Our investigations are carried out using a system code and also by analytical means. Further, we show that for the two qualitatively different global scalings that have been developed to fit the data contained in the ITER ELMy H-mode database, i.e. the normally used beta-dependent IPB98 y 2 scaling and the alternative beta-independent scalings, the power needed for high fusion performance differs substantially, typically by factors of three to four. Taken together, these two findings imply that lower power, smaller, and hence potentially lower cost, pilot plants and reactors than currently envisaged may be possible. The main parameters of a candidate low power (∼180 MW), high Q fus (∼5), relatively small (∼1.35 m major radius) device are given.},

Here n, T, and τ E are the ion density, ion temperature and energy confinement time respectively. However, tokamak plasmas are subject to operational limits and two important limits are a density limit and a beta limit. We show that when these limits are taken into account, nTτ E becomes almost independent of size; rather it depends mainly on the fusion power, P fus. In consequence, the fusion power gain, Q fus, a parameter closely linked to nTτ E is also independent of size. Hence, P fus and Q fus, two parameters of critical importance in reactor design, are actually tightly coupled. Further, we find that nTτ E is inversely dependent on the normalised beta, β N; an unexpected result that tends to favour lower power reactors. Our findings imply that the minimum power to achieve fusion reactor conditions is driven mainly by physics considerations, especially energy confinement, while the minimum device size is driven by technology and engineering considerations. Through dedicated R\&D and parallel developments in other fields, the technology and engineering aspects are evolving in a direction to make smaller devices feasible.},

  abstract = {Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak à Configuration Variable1,2, including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and ‘snowflake’ configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained ‘droplets’ on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied.},

  abstract = {The gap between a recently developed dynamical version of relaxed magnetohydrodynamics (RxMHD) and ideal MHD (IMHD) is bridged by approximating the zero-resistivity ‘ideal’ Ohm's law (IOL) constraint using an augmented Lagrangian method borrowed from optimization theory. The augmentation combines a pointwise vector Lagrange multiplier method and global penalty function method and can be used either for iterative enforcement of the IOL to arbitrary accuracy, or for constructing a continuous sequence of magnetofluid dynamics models running between RxMHD (no IOL) and weak IMHD (IOL almost everywhere). This is illustrated by deriving dispersion relations for linear waves on an MHD equilibrium.},

  abstract = {The two leading concepts for confining high-temperature fusion plasmas are the tokamak and the stellarator. Tokamaks are rotationally symmetric and use a large plasma current to achieve confinement, whereas stellarators are non-axisymmetric and employ three-dimensionally shaped magnetic field coils to twist the field and confine the plasma. As a result, the magnetic field of a stellarator needs to be carefully designed to minimize the collisional transport arising from poorly confined particle orbits, which would otherwise cause excessive power losses at high plasma temperatures. In addition, this type of transport leads to the appearance of a net toroidal plasma current, the so-called bootstrap current. Here, we analyse results from the first experimental campaign of the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, showing that its magnetic-field design allows good control of bootstrap currents and collisional transport. The energy confinement time is among the best ever achieved in stellarators, both in absolute figures (τE {$>$} 100 ms) and relative to the stellarator confinement scaling. The bootstrap current responds as predicted to changes in the magnetic mirror ratio. These initial experiments confirm several theoretically predicted properties of Wendelstein 7-X plasmas, and already indicate consistency with optimization measures.},

This paper presents both a quasi-axially symmetric and a quasi-isodynamic equilibrium obtained with ROSE and demonstrates two important features that are new to stellarator optimisation.

The independent variables x represent nested magnetic flux surfaces expressed in the inverse representation with toroidal flux coordinates, and the equations f (x) quantify equilibrium force balance errors at discrete points in real space. Discretizing with global Fourier-Zernike basis functions properly treats the magnetic axis and minimizes the number of coefficients needed to describe the flux surfaces. The pseudospectral method provides great flexibility in where the errors are evaluated, and the system of equations is efficiently solved with a Newton-Raphson iteration. Equilibria are computed and compared against VMEC for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric examples. The results show fast convergence rates and solutions with low errors throughout the plasma volume.},

  abstract = {Electrostatic turbulence, related structures and their effect on particle, heat and toroidal momentum transport are investigated in TORPEX simple magnetized plasmas using high-resolution diagnostics, control parameters, linear fluid models and nonlinear numerical simulations. The nature of the dominant instabilities is controlled by the value of the vertical magnetic field, Bv, relative to that of the toroidal field, BT. For Bv/BT {$>$} 3\%, only ideal interchange instabilities are observed. A critical pressure gradient to drive the interchange instability is experimentally identified. Interchange modes give rise to blobs, radially propagating filaments of enhanced plasma pressure. Blob velocities and sizes are obtained from electrostatic probe measurements using pattern recognition methods. The observed values span a wide range and are described by a single analytical expression, from the small blob size regime in which the blob velocity is limited by cross-field ion polarization currents, to the large blob size regime in which the limitation to the blob velocity comes from parallel currents to the sheath. As a first attempt at controlling the blob dynamical properties, limiter configurations with varying angles between field lines and the conducting surface of the limiter are explored. Mach probe measurements clearly demonstrate a link between toroidal flows and blobs. To complement probe data, a fast framing camera and a movable gas puffing system are installed. Density and light fluctuations show similar signatures of interchange activity. Further developments of optical diagnostics, including an image intensifier and laser-induced fluorescence, are under way. The effect of interchange turbulence on fast ion phase space dynamics is studied using movable fast ion source and detector in scenarios for which the development from linear waves into blobs is fully characterized. A theory validation project is conducted in parallel with TORPEX experiments, based on quantitative comparisons of observables that are defined in the same way in the data and in the output of numerical codes, including 2D and 3D local and global simulations.},

This paper presents the current wall-embedded Langmuir probe system installed on the Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV), as well as the analysis tool chain used to interpret the current-voltage characteristic obtained when the probes are operated in swept-bias conditions. The analysis is based on a four-parameter fit combined with a minimum temperature approach. In order to reduce the effect of plasma fluctuations and measurement noise, several current-voltage characteristics are usually averaged before proceeding to the fitting. The impact of this procedure on the results is investigated, as well as the possible role of finite resistances in the circuitry, which could lead to an overestimation of the temperature. We study the application of the procedure in a specific regime, the plasma detachment, where results from other diagnostics indicate that the electron temperature derived from the Langmuir probes might be overestimated. To address this issue, we explore other fitting models and, in particular, an extension of the asymmetric double probe fit, which features effects of sheath expansion. We show that these models yield lower temperatures (up to approximately 60\%) than the standard analysis in detached conditions, particularly for a temperature peak observed near the plasma strike point, but a discrepancy with other measurements remains. We explore a possible explanation for this observation, the presence of a fast electron population, and assess how robust the different methods are in such conditions.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to bridge the gap between tokamak reactor design and plasma physics. The analysis demonstrates that the overall design of a tokamak fusion reactor is determined almost entirely by the constraints imposed by nuclear physics and fusion engineering. Virtually, no plasma physics is required to determine the main design parameters of a reactor: a, R0, B0, Ti, Te, p, n, τE, I. The one exception is the value of the toroidal current I , which depends upon a combination of engineering and plasma physics. This exception, however, ultimately has a major impact on the feasibility of an attractive tokamak reactor. The analysis shows that the engineering/nuclear physics design makes demands on the plasma physics that must be satisfied in order to generate power. These demands are substituted into the well-known operational constraints arising in tokamak physics: the Troyon limit, Greenwald limit, kink stability limit, and bootstrap fraction limit. Unfortunately, a tokamak reactor designed on the basis of standard engineering and nuclear physics constraints does not scale to a reactor. Too much current is required to achieve the necessary confinement time for ignition. The combination of achievable bootstrap current plus current drive is not sufficient to generate the current demanded by the engineering design. Several possible solutions are discussed in detail involving advances in plasma physics or engineering. The main contribution of the present work is to demonstrate that the basic reactor design and its plasma physics consequences can be determined simply and analytically. The analysis thus provides a crisp, compact, logical framework that will hopefully lead to improved physical intuition for connecting plasma physic to tokamak reactor design.},

  abstract = {A major objective of the experimental program in the last phase of the W7-AS stellarator was to explore and demonstrate the high-β performance of advanced stellarators. MHD-quiescent discharges at low impurity radiation levels with volume averaged β-values of up to ?β?= 3.4\% have been achieved. A very important prerequisite was the attainment of the high density H-Mode (HDH) regime. This was made possible by the installation ofextensive graphite plasma facing components designed for island divertor operation. The co-directed neutral beam injection provided increased absorbed heating power of up to 3.2MW in high-β plasmas with B ? 1.25 T. The anticipated improved features concerning equilibrium and stability at high plasma β could be verified experimentally by the comparison of x-ray data with free boundary equilibrium calculations. The maximum β found in configurations with a rotational transform around ?ι = 0.5 is determined by the available heating power. No evidence ofa stability limit has been found in the accessible configuration space, and the discharges are remarkably quiescent at maximum β, most likely due the increase of the magnetic well depth. An increase in low m/n MHD activity is typically observed during the transition towards high β. The beneficial stability properties of net-current-free configurations could be demonstrated by comparison with configurations where a significant inductive current drive was involved. Current driven instabilities such as tearing modes and soft disruptions can prevent access to β-values as high as in the currentless case. The experimental results indicate that optimized stellarators such as W7-X can be considered as a viable option for an attractive stellarator fusion reactor.},

  abstract = {Non-resonant divertors (NRDs) separate the confined plasma from the surrounding plasma facing components (PFCs). The resulting striking field line intersection pattern on these PFCs is insensitive to plasma equilibrium effects. However, a complex scrape-off layer (SOL), created by chaotic magnetic topology in the plasma edge, connects the core plasma to the PFCs through varying magnetic flux tubes. The Compact Toroidal Hybrid (CTH) serves as a testbed to study this by scanning across its inductive current. Simulations observe a significant change of the chaotic edge structure and an effective distance between the confined plasma and the instrumented wall targets. The intersection pattern is observed to be a narrow helical band, which we claim is a resilient strike line pattern. However, signatures of finger-like structures, defined as heteroclinic tangles in chaotic domains, within the plasma edge connect the island chains to this resilient pattern. The dominant connection length field lines intersecting the targets are observed via heat flux modelling with EMC3-EIRENE. At low inductive current levels, the excursion of the field lines resembles a limited plasma wall scenario. At high currents, a private flux region is created in the area where the helical strike line pattern splits into two bands. These bands are divertor legs with distinct SOL parallel particle flow channels. The results demonstrate the NRD strike line pattern resiliency within CTH, but also show the underlying chaotic edge structure determining if the configuration is diverted or limited. This work supports future design efforts for a mechanical structure for the NRD.},

  abstract = {© 2017 IAEA, Vienna. Computational optimization has revolutionized the field of stellarator design. To date, optimizations have focused primarily on optimization of neoclassical confinement and ideal MHD stability, although limited optimization of other parameters has also been performed. The purpose of this paper is to outline a select set of new concepts for stellarator optimization that, when taken as a group, present a significant step forward in the stellarator concept. One of the criticisms that has been leveled at existing methods of design is the complexity of the resultant field coils. Recently, a new coil optimization code - COILOPT++, which uses a spline instead of a Fourier representation of the coils, - was written and included in the STELLOPT suite of codes. The advantage of this method is that it allows the addition of real space constraints on the locations of the coils. The code has been tested by generating coil designs for optimized quasi-axisymmetric stellarator plasma configurations of different aspect ratios. As an initial exercise, a constraint that the windings be vertical was placed on large major radius half of the non-planar coils. Further constraints were also imposed that guaranteed that sector blanket modules could be removed from between the coils, enabling a sector maintenance scheme. Results of this exercise will be presented. New ideas on methods for the optimization of turbulent transport have garnered much attention since these methods have led to design concepts that are calculated to have reduced turbulent heat loss. We have explored possibilities for generating an experimental database to test whether the reduction in transport that is predicted is consistent with experimental observations. To this end, a series of equilibria that can be made in the now latent QUASAR experiment have been identified that will test the predicted transport scalings. Fast particle confinement studies aimed at developing a generalized optimization algorithm are also discussed. A new algorithm developed for the design of the scraper element on W7-X is presented along with ideas for automating the optimization approach.},

In the last experimental campaign of W7-AS, volume-averaged β values {$>$}3\% have been achieved. The underlying experimental changes leading to these results are briefly reviewed. The equilibrium characteristics expected from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory are modeled in a simplified picture and compared with three-dimensional equilibrium calculations. A wide range of parameters has been covered in the experiments with and without net toroidal currents. Experimental data are compared with free-boundary equilibrium calculations and exhibit good agreement. The high-β equilibria usually showed only small MHD activity. The most prominent activities are low-frequency pressure-driven modes connected with low-order rationals also expected from numerical calculations using the CAS3D code, and Alfvén modes driven by energetic particles from the tangential neutral beam injection. Comparison of experimentally measured frequencies and mode structures from soft-X-ray tomography with theoretical predictions also shows the improving understanding of these modes in stellarators. The agreement of experiment and theory gives confidence in the predictions for W7-X.},

Two basic scenarios to reconcile this are investigated with respect to equilibrium, stability and boundary structures. The first scenario with freely evolving bootstrap current realizes proper divertor operation by adjusting the vacuum magnetic field. As the bootstrap current evolves on the L/R time scale (40s) this needs long discharges. The second scenario compensates the net current by proper ECCD keeping the boundary structures basically constant sacrificing the low-shear ι-profile (mismatching ECCD and bootstrap current). Both scenarios seem to be viable experimental candidates.

We also propose a measure for quasisymmetry on the computed surfaces and use it to design coils that generate a magnetic field that is quasisymmetric on those surfaces.

Using an adjoint approach, we are able to obtain analytic derivatives for this optimization problem, yielding an efficient gradient-based algorithm. Starting from an initial coil set that presents nested magnetic surfaces for a large fraction of the volume, our method converges rapidly to coil systems generating fields with excellent quasisymmetry and low particle losses.

Our approach directly optimizes coil shapes and coil currents to produce a vacuum quasi-symmetric magnetic field with a target rotational transform on the magnetic axis. This approach differs from the traditional two-stage approach in which first a magnetic configuration with desirable physics properties is found, and then coils to approximately realize this magnetic configuration are designed. The proposed single-stage approach allows us to find a compromise between confinement and engineering requirements, i.e., find easy-to-build coils with good confinement properties. Using forward and adjoint sensitivities, we derive derivatives of the physical quantities in the objective, which is constrained by a nonlinear periodic differential equation. In two numerical examples, we compare different gradient-based descent algorithms and find that incorporating approximate second-order derivative information through a quasi-Newton method is crucial for convergence. We also explore the optimization landscape in the neighborhood of a minimizer and find many directions in which the objective is mostly flat, indicating ample freedom to find simple and thus easy-to-build coils.},

  abstract = {Many stellarator coil design problems are plagued by multiple minima, where the locally optimal coil sets can sometimes vary substantially in performance. As a result, solving a coil design problem a single time with a local optimization algorithm is usually insufficient and better optima likely do exist. To address this problem, we propose a global optimization algorithm for the design of stellarator coils and outline how to apply box constraints to the physical positions of the coils. The algorithm has a global exploration phase that searches for interesting regions of design space and is followed by three local optimization algorithms that search in these interesting regions (a "global-to-local" approach). The first local algorithm (phase I), following the globalization phase, is based on near-axis expansions and finds stellarator coils that optimize for quasisymmetry in the neighborhood of a magnetic axis. The second local algorithm (phase II) takes these coil sets and optimizes them for nested flux surfaces and quasisymmetry on a toroidal volume. The final local algorithm (phase III) polishes these configurations for an accurate approximation of quasisymmetry. Using our global algorithm, we study the trade-off between coil length, aspect ratio, rotational transform, and quality of quasi-axisymmetry. The database of stellarators, which comprises almost 140,000 coil sets, is available online and is called QUASR, for "QUAsi-symmetric Stellarator Repository".},

The method works particularly well in configurations with only one field period. We examine the properties of these newfound quasi-isodynamic configurations, including their bootstrap currents, particle confinement, and available energy for trapped-electron driven turbulence, as well as the degree to which they change when a finite pressure profile is added. We finally discuss the differences between the magnetic axes of the optimized solutions and their respective initial conditions, and conclude with the prospects for future quasi-isodynamic optimization.},

  abstract = {A number of problems in physics can be reduced to the study of a measure-preserving mapping of a plane onto itself. One example is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, i.e., two coupled nonlinear oscillators. These are among the simplest deterministic systems that can have chaotic solutions. According to a theorem of Kolmogorov, Arnol'd, and Moser, these systems may also have more ordered orbits lying on curves that divide the plane. The existence of each of these orbit types depends sensitively on both the parameters of the problem, and on the initial conditions. The problem addressed in this paper is that of finding when given KAM orbits exist. The guiding hypothesis is that the disappearance of a KAM surface is associated with a sudden change from stability to instability of nearby periodic orbits. The relation between KAM surfaces and periodic orbits has been explored extensively here by the numerical computation of a particular mapping. An important part of this procedure is the introduction of two quantities, the residue and the mean residue, that permit the stability of many orbits to be estimated from the extrapolation of results obtained for a few orbits. The results are distilled into a series of assertions. These are consistent with all that is previously known, strongly supported by numerical results, and lead to a method for deciding the existence of any given KAM surface computationally. © 1979 American Institute of Physics.},

The first devices of the Wendelstein line were W I-A and W I-B, both racetrack-type stellarators. In the circular l = 2 stellarator W II-A, steady-state barium plasmas were investigated and were found to be governed by collisional diffusion. In W II-B, mainly Ohmic heating was applied. The main stellarator experiment at IPP Garching is W VII-A; after a period of Ohmic heating, the first net-current-free plasma was achieved in 1980. Plasma parameters of up to Tj= 1 keV and n(0) = 1014cm-3could be reached by this method. A further heating method is ECRH, which yields maximum electron temperatures of Te ≥ 2 keV. The paper describes the major results of the devices mentioned and gives a short survey of further planning. © 1985 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {This thesis describes physics research carried out at the Columbia Neutral Torus (CNT) stellarator after its adaptation from a non-neutral plasma experiment to a device relevant to magnetic fusion energy research. Results are presented in the areas of plasma heating and related topics (microwave-assisted plasma start-up, overdense heating, inversion of stellarator images), as well as to stellarator stability and related topics (high β, error fields). This thesis also describes the engineering improvements which enabled the said adaptation of CNT. The first step of that process involved the installation of a low-power, pulsed 2.45 GHz magnetron. In those initial experiments it was found that the simultaneous use of microwave start-up and of an emissive hot cathode resulted in non-linearly increased electron densities, implying a synergy between the two start-up methods. Then, a 10 kW, 2.45 GHz heating system was commissioned including a custom-designed transmission line and launch antenna. Highly overdense plasmas (a factor of 4 above the cutoff density) were obtained with this system, both for O-mode and X-mode polarization. The analysis of Langmuir probe profiles of density and temperature required the accurate mapping of the minor radius in the plasma, which motivated a study of CNT error fields. This resulted in a new numerical method for inferring coil misalignments from flux surface measurements. The improved knowledge of the actual magnetic field geometry of CNT permitted to develop and successfully apply an inversion technique to experimental plasma images. This technique (“onion peeling”) reconstructs radial emissivity profiles, and can be considered a 3D generalization of Abel inversion. Finally, simulations of high-β plasma equilibria in different CNT magnetic configurations indicate that (1) ballooning stability limits should be accessible at volume-averaged β as low as 0.9\% and (2) ballooning-stable β values as high as 3.0\% should be attainable with heating powers as low as 40-100 kW and 1-3 MW respectively, according to stellarator energy confinement scaling laws.},

V3FIT is used to reconstruct an axisymmetric DIII-D equilibrium using experimentally observed magnetic diagnostic signals.

In a non-quasi-symmetric magnetic field, the average radial electric field is determined by parallel viscosity, which in turn is usually governed by collisional processes. Locally, the radial electric field may be affected by turbulent Reynolds stress producing zonal flows, but on a radial average taken over several ion gyroradii, it is determined by parallel viscosity, at least if the turbulence is electrostatic and obeys the conventional gyrokinetic orderings. This differs from the situation in a tokamak, where there is no flow damping by parallel viscosity in the symmetry direction and the turbulent Reynolds stress may affect the global radial electric field.},

  abstract = {The expression for the long-mean-free-path limit of the bootstrap current in stellarators is rederived in such a way that the expansion procedure is identical to that used in the corresponding calculation for a tokamak. In addition, the first correction due to finite collisionality is calculated and shown to vanish in quasi-isodynamic configurations without net current. This correction, which is proportional to the square root of the collisionality, is found to compare well with a numerical solution of the first-order drift kinetic equation in spherical tokamak geometry. Numerically, it appears that there is a similar correction in general stellarator geometry, which however depends on the strength of the radial electric field. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {The theory of plasma confinement by non-axisymmetric magnetic fields is reviewed. Such fields are used to confine fusion plasmas in stellarators, where in contrast to tokamaks and reversed-field pinches the magnetic field generally does not possess any continuous symmetry. The discussion is focussed on magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium conditions, collisionless particle orbits, and the kinetic theory of equilbrium and transport. Each of these topics is fundamentally affected by the absence of symmetry in the magnetic field: the field lines need not trace out nested flux surfaces, the particle orbits may not be confined, and the cross-field transport can be very large. Nevertheless, by tailoring the magnetic field appropriately, well-behaved equilibria with good confinement can be constructed, potentially offering an attractive route to magnetic fusion. In this article, the mathematical apparatus to describe stellarator plasmas is developed from first principles and basic elements underlying confinement optimization are introduced.},

  abstract = {Anisotropic heat conduction in a plasma embedded in a magnetic field with irregular, possibly chaotic, field lines is discussed. If the collisional mean free path exceeds the electron gyroradius, the heat conductivity is much larger along the field lines than across them, and this enhances the transport across a domain where good flux surfaces do not exist. Recognising that anisotropic heat conduction may be cast in a variational form, and by constructing increasingly sophisticated trial functions that are based on invariant and almost-invariant structures under the magnetic field-line flow, bounds are derived on this enhancement and on the temperature variation along the magnetic field. In this way, remarkably accurate approximations for the temperature can be rapidly constructed without solving the diffusion equation, even in the small perpendicular-diffusion limit when the solution for the temperature is dominated by the fractal structure the magnetic field lines.},

  abstract = {Combined plasma–coil optimization approaches for designing stellarators are discussed and a new method for calculating free-boundary equilibria for multiregion relaxed magnetohydrodynmics (MRxMHD) is proposed. Four distinct categories of stellarator optimization, two of which are novel approaches, are the fixed-boundary optimization, the generalized fixed-boundary optimization, the quasi-free-boundary optimization, and the free-boundary (coil) optimization. These are described using the MRxMHD energy functional, the Biot–Savart integral, the coil-penalty functional and the virtual casing integral and their derivatives. The proposed free-boundary equilibrium calculation differs from existing methods in how the boundary-value problem is posed, and for the new approach it seems that there is not an associated energy minimization principle because a non-symmetric functional arises. We propose to solve the weak formulation of this problem using a spectral-Galerkin method, and this will reduce the free-boundary equilibrium calculation to something comparable to a fixed-boundary calculation. In our discussion of combined plasma–coil optimization algorithms, we emphasize the importance of the stability matrix.},

  abstract = {Wendelstein 7-AS was the first modular stellarator device to test some basic elements of stellarator optimization: a reduced Shafranov shift and improved stability properties resulted in β-values up to 3.4\% (at 0.9 T). This operational limit was determined by power balance and impurity radiation without noticeable degradation of stability or a violent collapse. The partial reduction of neoclassical transport could be verified in agreement with calculations indicating the feasibility of the concept of drift optimization. A full neoclassical optimization, in particular a minimization of the bootstrap current was beyond the scope of this project. A variety of non-ohmic heating and current drive scenarios by ICRH, NBI and in particular, ECRH were tested and compared successfully with their theoretical predictions. Besides, new heating schemes of overdense plasmas were developed such as RF mode conversion heating—Ordinary mode, Extraordinary mode, Bernstein-wave (OXB) heating—or 2nd harmonic O-mode (O2) heating. The energy confinement was about a factor of 2 above ISS95 without degradation near operational boundaries. A number of improved confinement regimes such as core electron-root confinement with central T e ≤ 7 keV and regimes with strongly sheared radial electric field at the plasma edge resulting in T i ≤ 1.7 keV were obtained. As the first non-tokamak device, W7-AS achieved the H-mode and moreover developed a high density H-mode regime (HDH) with strongly reduced impurity confinement that allowed quasi-steady-state operation (τ ≈ 65 · τ E ) at densities \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/50/5/053001/ppcf224941in001.gif] \{\textbackslash bar \{n\}\_\{\textbackslash rme\} \textbackslash cong 4 \textbackslash times 10\^\{20\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mbox\{m\}\^\{-3\}\} (at 2.5 T). The first island divertor was tested successfully and operated with stable partial detachment in agreement with numerical simulations. With these results W7-AS laid the physics background for operation of an optimized low-shear steady-state stellarator.},

The radial resolution of the MHD equations is significantly improved by separating R and Z into contributions from even and odd poloidal harmonics which are individually analytic near the magnetic axis. A free boundary equilibrium results when ωp is varied to make the total pressure 1 2B2 + p continuous at the plasma surface Σp and when the vacuum magnetic field Bv satisfies the Neumann condition Bv·dΣp = 0. The vacuum field is decomposed as Bv = B0 + ∇φ, where B0 is the field arising from plasma currents and external coils and φ is an single-valued potential necessary to satisfy Bv\{radical dot\}dΣp = 0 when p ≠ 0. A Green's function method is used to obtain an integral equation over Σp for the scalar magnetic potential φ = Σφmn sin(mθ - nζ). A linear matrix equation is solved for φmn to determine 1 2B2v on the boundary.

The behavior of electron transport is found to be the same over a wide range of energies but the behavior of ion transport for low‐energy ions is found to be different than that for high‐energy ions. Furthermore, the electron fluxes do not vary with the change in the radial ambipolar electric field nearly as much as do the ion fluxes. Thus the particle diffusion is controlled by the electrons. A nonradial ambipolar electric field is induced by ion drift. This electric field enhances the transport by about 15\%–20\%. A convenient graphical method that allows one to determine the magnitude of the radial ambipolar field for machines with different parameters is presented. Numerical examples show that electron energy confinement time is comparable to the ion energy confinement time for all the different size stellarators studied. Although the neoclassical losses are large, it is shown that ignition can be achieved in a reasonably sized stellarator reactor. Finally, fron the standpoint of reactor economics, the confinement scaling law shows that in order to increase nτ, it is better to increase the aspect ratio than the overall dimensions of the reactor.},

This article chiefly addresses whether the stability of two interface configurations with continuous rotational transform, but vanishing interface separation, is different from the stability of a single interface configuration with jump in the rotational transform. To make the problem analytically tractable, we derive the equilibria and stability of a multi-interface plasma in a periodic cylinder, generalizing the cylindrical treatment of Kaiser and Uecker (2004 Q. J. Mech. Appl. Math. 57 1--17). For two interfaces with no jump in rotational transform, we show that one eigenmode has in-phase interface displacements, and an eigenvalue that converges to the single barrier case in the limit of vanishing interface width. The complementary eigenmode is out-of-phase, and highly unstable. Physically, the unstable eigenmode is driven by the parallel current, and caused by the high shear required to match the different rotational transform on each interface. In the limit that the interface separation vanishes, the shear and parallel current density become infinite, and the parallel current between the interfaces nonzero. Surfaces with out-of-phase displacements will then collide, unless the amplitude goes to zero as the interface separation goes to zero. These results suggest the hypothesis that KAM barriers with different irrational rotational transform on either side may be allowable without violating nonlinear stability.},

The SPEC code implements multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics (MRxMHD), where the solution relaxes to a Taylor state in each region while maintaining force balance across the interfaces between regions. As the number of regions increases, the MRxMHD solution approaches the ideal MHD solution assuming a continuum of nested flux surfaces.

  abstract = {Two approaches to defining almost-invariant surfaces for magnetic fields with imperfect magnetic surfaces are compared. Both methods are based on treating magnetic field-line flow as a 1½-dimensional Hamiltonian (or Lagrangian) dynamical system. In the quadratic-flux minimizing surface approach, the integral of the square of the action gradient over the toroidal and poloidal angles is minimized, while in the ghost surface approach a gradient flow between a minimax and an action-minimizing orbit is used. In both cases the almost-invariant surface is constructed as a family of periodic pseudo-orbits, and consequently it has a rational rotational transform. The construction of quadratic-flux minimizing surfaces is simple, and easily implemented using a new magnetic field-line tracing method. The construction of ghost surfaces requires the representation of a pseudo field line as an (in principle) infinite-dimensional vector and also is inherently slow for systems near integrability. As a test problem the magnetic field-line Hamiltonian is constructed analytically for a topologically toroidal, non-integrable ABC-flow model, and both types of almost-invariant surface are constructed numerically.},

A method is introduced which enables the perturbation harmonics of the field line Hamiltonian (which determines the size of islands and the degree of chaos) to be approximated quickly. The method is based upon quadratic-flux minimizing surfaces which pass directly through both the X and O points of the island chains. Using a suitable measure of island width, it is possible to utilize standard numerical optimization methods to achieve desirable configurations. A major island chain in the H-1NF heliac vacuum field has been made to both disappear and to reappear with opposite phase. These results have significance for self-healing phenomena and the method is generally applicable to all stellarators and 11/2-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamical systems.},

The full set of ideal-MHD constraints is applied only on a discrete set of toroidal magnetic surfaces (invariant tori), which act as barriers against leakage of magnetic flux, helicity, and pressure through chaotic field-line transport. It is argued that a necessary condition for such invariant tori to exist is that they have fixed, irrational rotational transforms. In the toroidal domains bounded by these surfaces, full Taylor relaxation is assumed, thus leading to Beltrami fields ∇\{\textbackslash times\}B = λB, where λ is constant within each domain. Two distinct eigenvalue problems for λ arise in this formulation, depending on whether fluxes and helicity are fixed, or boundary rotational transforms. These are studied in cylindrical geometry and in a three-dimensional toroidal region of annular cross section. In the latter case, an application of a residue criterion is used to determine the threshold for connected chaos.\textbackslash n},

QFMin pseudo-orbits, which are coordinate-dependent, are field lines obtained from a modified magnetic field, and ghost-surface pseudo-orbits are obtained by displacing closed field lines in the direction of steepest descent of magnetic action, ∮A⋅dl. A generalized Hamiltonian definition of ghost surfaces is given and specialized to the usual Lagrangian definition. A modified Hamilton's Principle is introduced that allows the use of Lagrangian integration for calculation of the QFMin pseudo-orbits. Numerical calculations show QFMin and Lagrangian ghost surfaces give very similar results for a chaotic magnetic field perturbed from an integrable case, and this is explained using a perturbative construction of an auxiliary poloidal angle for which QFMin and Lagrangian ghost surfaces are the same up to second order. While presented in the context of 3-dimensional magnetic field line systems, the concepts are applicable to defining almost-invariant tori in other 112 degree-of-freedom nonintegrable Lagrangian/Hamiltonian systems.},

Ideal force balance is when the pressure gradient is supported by the Lorentz force, ∇p=j×B. We discuss the implications of allowing for a chaotic magnetic field on the solutions to this equation. We argue that the solutions are pathological and not suitable for numerical calculations. If the pressure and magnetic field are continuous, the only nontrivial solutions have an uncountable infinity of discontinuities in the pressure gradient and current. The problems arise from the arbitrarily small length scales in the structure of the field, and the consequence of ideal force balance that the pressure is constant along the field-lines, B∇p=0. A simple method to ameliorate the singularities is to include a small but finite perpendicular diffusion. A self-consistent set of equilibrium equations is described, and some algorithmic approaches aimed at solving these equations are discussed. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {The variational principle for relaxed toroidal plasma-vacuum systems with pressure is applied to axially periodic circular cylinders. More pre- cisely, equilibria with cylindrical symmetry are investigated for their po- tential to be a relaxed state. Such equilibria are characterized by their pinch ratio µ, the jump δ of the pitch angle of the magnetic field across the plasma–vacuum interface, a constant plasma pressure β, and the ratio l of wall radius over interface radius. In the limit of an infinitely long cylinder the necessary and sufficient condition for the equilibrium to be a relaxed state defines one or two intervals of allowed values of the pinch ratio µ, which depend still on the other parameters. These intervals are contained in the interval known from Taylor’s theory, but are generally smaller. They are shrinking with increasing plasma pressure β or increasing radius ratio l. In particular, in the field-free limit case β = 1, for l exceeding the critical value lc ≈ 4.983, or for a vanishing δ, these intervals are zero.},

  abstract = {The separation between the last closed flux surface of a plasma and the external coils that magnetically confine it is a limiting factor in the construction of fusion-capable plasma devices. This plasma-coil separation must be large enough so that components such as a breeding blanket and neutron shielding can fit between the plasma and the coils. Plasma-coil separation affects reactor size, engineering complexity, and particle loss due to field ripple. For some plasmas it can be difficult to produce the desired flux surface shaping with distant coils, and for other plasmas it is infeasible altogether. Here, we seek to understand the underlying physics that limits plasma-coil separation and explain why some configurations require close external coils. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that the limiting plasma-coil separation is set by the shortest scale length of the magnetic field as expressed by the \$\textbackslash nabla\$B tensor. We tested this hypothesis on a database of {$>$} 40 stellarator and tokamak configurations. Within this database, the coil-to-plasma distance compared to the minor radius varies by over an order of magnitude. The magnetic scale length is well correlated to the coil-to-plasma distance of actual coil designs generated using the REGCOIL method [Landreman, Nucl. Fusion 57, 046003 (2017)]. Additionally, this correlation reveals a general trend that larger plasma-coil separation is possible with a small number of field periods.},

  abstract = {Topology optimization, a technique to determine where material should be placed within a predefined volume in order to minimize a physical objective, is used across a wide range of scientific fields and applications. A general application for topology optimization is inverse magnetostatics; a desired magnetic field is prescribed, and a distribution of steady currents is computed to produce that target field. In the present work, electromagnetic coils are designed by magnetostatic topology optimization, using volume elements (voxels) of electric current, constrained so the current is divergence-free. Compared to standard electromagnet shape optimization, our method has the advantage that the nonlinearity in the Biot–Savart law with respect to position is avoided, enabling convex cost functions and a useful reformulation of topology optimization as sparse regression. To demonstrate, we consider the application of designing electromagnetic coils for a class of plasma experiments known as stellarators. We produce topologically-exotic coils for several new stellarator designs and show that these solutions can be interpolated into a filamentary representation and then further optimized.},

These sheets are located on resonant flux surfaces that are associated with rational values of the rotational transform. We study the possibility of eliminating these singularities by suitable modifications of the plasma boundary, which we prescribe in a fixed boundary setting. We find that relatively straightforward iterative procedures can be used to eliminate weak current sheets that are generated at resonant flux surfaces by the nonlinear interactions of resonating wall harmonics. These types of procedures may prove useful in the design of fusion devices with configurations that enjoy improved stability and transport properties.},

Indications for a core-electron-root were found. The energy confinement times are in line with the international stellarator scaling, despite unfavourable wall conditions, i.e. large areas of metal surfaces and particle sources from the limiter close to the plasma volume. Well controlled shorter hydrogen discharges at higher power (4 MW ECRH power for 1 s) and longer discharges at lower power (0.7 MW ECRH power for 6 s) could be routinely established after proper wall conditioning. The fairly large set of diagnostic systems running in the end of the 10 weeks operation campaign provided first insights into expected and unexpected physics of optimized stellarators.},

Here, the ions are indirectly heated, and at a central density of                                                              a temperature of                                                              with                                                              was transiently accomplished, which corresponds to                                                              with a peak diamagnetic energy of                                                              and volume-averaged normalized plasma pressure                                                              . The routine access to high plasma densities was opened with boronization of the first wall. After boronization, the oxygen impurity content was reduced by a factor of 10, the carbon impurity content by a factor of 5. The reduced (edge) plasma radiation level gives routinely access to higher densities without radiation collapse, e.g. well above                                                              line integrated density and                                                              central temperatures at moderate ECRH power. Both X2 and O2 mode ECRH schemes were successfully applied. Core turbulence was measured with a phase contrast imaging diagnostic and suppression of turbulence during pellet injection was observed.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates energetic electron transport in magnetized toroidal plasmas with magnetic fields characterized by island chains and regions of stochastic field lines produced by coil perturbations. We report on experiments performed in the DIII-D tokamak, which utilize electron cyclotron heating and current drive pulses to ‘tag’ electron populations within different locations across the discharge. The cross-field transport of these populations is then inferred from electron cyclotron emission measurements and gamma emission signals from scintillator detectors. Two types of energetic particles are distinguished and discussed: non-relativistic suprathermal electrons and relativistic runaway electrons. The magnetic field topology in each discharge is reconstructed with field-line tracing codes, which are also used to determine the location and scale of magnetic islands and stochastic regions. Comparison of simulations and experiments suggests that suprathermal transport is suppressed when the tagging is performed at a smaller radial location than the location of the ��=1q=1q = 1 island chain and enhanced otherwise. Here q is the safety factor. We further demonstrate that increasing the width of the stochastic region within the edge plasma yields enhancement of the suprathermal electron transport.},

Suggestions for addressing the critical issues of tokamaks can only be validated when presented with sufficient specificity that validating experiments can be designed. The purpose of this paper is to provide that specificity for nonaxisymmetric shaping. Whether nonaxisymmetric shaping is essential, or just an alternative strategy, to the success of tokamak fusion systems can only be assessed after axisymmetric alternatives are suggested and subjected to a similar study. Sequences of three-field-period quasiaxisymmetric plasmas are studied. These sequences address the questions: (1) What can be achieved at various levels of nonaxisymmetric shaping? (2) What simplifications to the coils can be achieved by going to a larger aspect ratio? (3) What range of shaping can be achieved in a single experimental facility? The sequences of plasmas found in this study provide a set of interesting and potentially important configurations.},

For a given number of field periods, the toroidal excursion of coil winding is reduced as the plasma aspect ratio is increased.

The numerical solutions of the MRxMHD equilibria have been constructed using the Stepped Pressure Equilibrium Code (SPEC) (Hudson et al 2012 Phys. Plasmas 19 112502). In principle, SPEC could also be established to describe the MRxMHD stability of an equilibrium. In this work, a theoretical framework is developed to relate the second variation of the energy functional to the so-called Hessian matrix, enabling the prediction of MHD linear instabilities of cylindrical plasmas, and is implemented in SPEC. The negative and positive eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix predict the stability of an equilibrium. Verification studies of SPEC stability results with the M3D-C 1 code and the tearing mode Δ′ criterion have been conducted for ideal and resistive MHD instabilities, respectively, in a pressureless cylindrical tokamak, and have shown good agreement. Our stability analysis is a critical step towards understanding the MHD stability of three-dimensional MHDs where nested flux surfaces, magnetic islands and stochastic regions co-exist.},

First, neoclassical phenomena are computed for the LHD and W7-X stellarators using several versions of the drift-kinetic equation, including the commonly used incompressible-E\,×\,B-drift approximation and two other variants, corresponding to different effective particle trajectories. It is found that for electric fields below roughly one third of the resonant value, the different formulations give nearly identical results, demonstrating the incompressible E\,×\,B-drift approximation is quite accurate in this regime. However, near the electric field resonance, the models yield substantially different results. We also compare results for various collision operators, including the full linearized Fokker-Planck operator. At low collisionality, the radial transport driven by radial gradients is nearly identical for the different operators; while in other cases, it is found to be important that collisions conserve momentum.},

  abstract = {The magnetic field that supports tokamak and stellarator plasmas must be produced by coils well separated from the plasma. However, the larger the separation, the more difficult it is to produce a given magnetic field in the plasma region, so plasma configurations should be chosen that can be supported as efficiently as possible by distant coils. The efficiency of an externally generated magnetic field is a measure of the field's shaping component magnitude at the plasma compared to the magnitude near the coils; the efficiency of a plasma equilibrium can be measured using the efficiency of the required external shaping field. Counterintuitively, plasma shapes with low curvature and spectral width may have low efficiency, whereas plasma shapes with sharp edges may have high efficiency. Two precise measures of magnetic field efficiency, which correctly identify such differences in difficulty, will be examined. These measures, which can be expressed as matrices, relate the externally produced normal magnetic field on the plasma surface to the either the normal field or current on a distant control surface. A singular value decomposition (SVD) of either matrix yields an efficiency ordered basis for the magnetic field distributions. Calculations are carried out for both tokamak and stellarator cases. For axisymmetric surfaces with circular cross-section, the SVD is calculated analytically, and the range of poloidal and toroidal mode numbers that can be controlled to a given desired level is determined. If formulated properly, these efficiency measures are independent of the coordinates used to parameterize the surfaces.},

Fusion 27 867), its generalization using truncated singular value decomposition, and a Tikhonov regularization approach we call REGCOIL in which the squared current density is included in the objective function. Considering W7-X and NCSX geometries, and for any desired level of regularization, we find the REGCOIL approach simultaneously achieves lower surface-averaged and maximum values of both current density (on the coil winding surface) and normal magnetic field (on the desired plasma surface). This approach therefore can simultaneously improve the free-boundary reconstruction of the target plasma shape while substantially increasing the minimum distances between coils, preventing collisions between coils while improving access for ports and maintenance. The REGCOIL method also allows finer control over the level of regularization, it preserves convexity to ensure the local optimum found is the global optimum, and it eliminates two pathologies of NESCOIL: the resulting coil shapes become independent of the arbitrary choice of angles used to parameterize the coil surface, and the resulting coil shapes converge rather than diverge as Fourier resolution is increased. We therefore contend that REGCOIL should be used instead of NESCOIL for applications in which a fast and robust method for coil calculation is needed, such as when targeting coil complexity in fixed-boundary plasma optimization, or for scoping new stellarator geometries.},

Our calculation in contrast does not use the Frenet–Serret frame. The transformation between the Garren–Boozer approach and cylindrical coordinates is derived, and the two approaches are shown to be equivalent if the axis curvature does not vanish.

Previously, quasisymmetric magnetic fields have been identified by applying black-box optimization algorithms to minimize symmetry-breaking Fourier modes of the field strength . Here, instead, we directly construct magnetic fields in cylindrical coordinates that are quasisymmetric to leading order in the distance from the magnetic axis, without using optimization. The method involves solution of a one-dimensional nonlinear ordinary differential equation, originally derived by Garren \& Boozer (Phys. Fluids B, vol. 3, 1991, p. 2805). We demonstrate the usefulness and accuracy of this optimization-free approach by providing the results of this construction as input to the codes VMEC and BOOZ-XFORM, confirming the purity and scaling of the magnetic spectrum. The space of magnetic fields that are quasisymmetric to this order is parameterized by the magnetic axis shape along with three other real numbers, one of which reflects the on-axis toroidal current density, and another one of which is zero for stellarator symmetry. The method here could be used to generate good initial conditions for conventional optimization, and its speed enables exhaustive searches of parameter space.},

  abstract = {A method is demonstrated to optimize a stellarator's geometry to eliminate magnetic islands and achieve other desired physics properties at the same time. For many physics quantities that have been used in stellarator optimization, including quasisymmetry, neoclassical transport, and magnetohydrodynamic stability, it is convenient to use a magnetic equilibrium representation that assures the existence of magnetic surfaces. However, this representation hides the possible presence of magnetic islands, which are typically undesirable. To include both surface-based objectives and island widths in a single optimization, two fixed-boundary equilibrium calculations are run at each iteration of the optimization: one that enforces the existence of magnetic surfaces (VMEC [S. P. Hirshman and J. C. Whitson, Phys. Fluids 26, 3553 (1983)]), and one that does not (SPEC [S. R. Hudson, et al, Phys. Plasmas 19, 112502 (2012)]). By penalizing the island residues in the objective function, the two magnetic field representations are brought into agreement during the optimization. An example is presented in which, particularly on the surface where quasisymmetry was targeted, quasisymmetry is achieved more accurately than in previously published examples.},

  abstract = {Quasi-symmetry can greatly improve the confinement of energetic particles and thermal plasma in a stellarator. The magnetic field of a quasi-symmetric stellarator at high plasma pressure is significantly affected by the bootstrap current, but the computational cost of accurate stellarator bootstrap calculations has precluded use inside optimization. Here, a new efficient method is demonstrated for optimization of quasi-symmetric stellarator configurations such that the bootstrap current profile is consistent with the geometry. The approach is based on the fact that all neoclassical phenomena in quasi-symmetry are isomorphic to those in axisymmetry. Therefore, accurate formulas for the bootstrap current in tokamaks, which can be evaluated rapidly, can be applied also in stellarators. The deviation between this predicted parallel current and the actual parallel current in the magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium is penalized in the objective function, and the current profile of the equilibrium is included in the parameter space. Quasi-symmetric configurations with significant pressure are thereby obtained with self-consistent bootstrap current and excellent confinement. In a comparison of fusion-produced alpha particle confinement across many stellarators, the new configurations have significantly lower alpha energy losses than many previous designs.},

The second is a surface integral over a surface current on the equilibrium boundary. This method is computationally desirable as the calculation does not grow as the radial resolution of the volume integral.

In this configuration, a vacuum flux surface with rotational transform of n/m = 1/2 is created at the mid-radius of the vacuum flux surfaces. If no error fields are present a vanishingly small n/m = 5/10 island chain should be present. Modeling indicates that if an n = 1 perturbing field is applied by the trim coils, a large n/m = 1/2 island chain will be opened. This island chain is used to create a perturbation large enough to be imaged by the diagnostic. Phase and amplitude scans of the applied field allow the measurement of a small m intrinsic island chain with a phase relative to the first module of the W7-X experiment. These error fields are determined to be small and easily correctable by the trim coil system.},

For our purposes, flexibility is defined by the range of values the rotational transform can take on the magnetic axis of the vacuum field while maintaining satisfactory quasisymmetry. We show that accounting for configuration flexibility during the modular coil design improves flexibility beyond that attained by previous methods. Careful placement of planar control coils and the incorporation of an integrability objective enhance the quasisymmetry and nested flux surface volume of each configuration. We show that it is possible to achieve flexibility, quasisymmetry, and nested flux surface volume to reasonable degrees with a relatively simple coil set through an NCSX-like example. This example coil design is optimized to achieve three rotational transform targets and nested flux surface volumes in each magnetic configuration larger than the NCSX design plasma volume. Our work suggests that there is a tradeoff between flexibility, quasisymmetry, and volume of nested flux surfaces.},

In this work generalized perturbed equilibrium code is used to determine optimally efficient spectrum for driving total, core, and edge neoclassical toroidal viscosity torque. These fundamental modes of 3D control are shown to have consistent outboard structures across a wide variety of plasma scenarios and machines. Given these target spectra, the currents and 3D geometry of multiple coils can be optimized to increase efficient drive for the physics of interest without undesired secondary effects. Here, this nonlinear optimization is demonstrated using the flexible optimized coils using space-curves code. The optimized coils are individually distorted in space, creating toroidal ‘arrays’ containing a variety of shapes that often wrap around a significant poloidal extent of the machine. Importantly, efficient coupling can be maintained even when enforcing large distances between coils and the plasma during the geometric optimization of coil designs. The physics-driven optimization presented here thus provides a practical path to utilizing coils built on the exterior of the vacuum chamber in future reactors to obtain the powerful 3D field benefits demonstrated on current machines with close, internal coils.},

  abstract = {A numerical investigation is carried out to understand the equilibrium β-limit in a classical stellarator. The stepped-pressure equilibrium code (Hudson et al., Phys. Plasmas, vol. 19 (11), 2012) is used in order to assess whether or not magnetic islands and stochastic field-lines can emerge at high β. Two modes of operation are considered: a zero-net-current stellarator and a fixed-iota stellarator. Despite the fact that relaxation is allowed (Taylor, Rev. Mod. Phys., vol. 58 (3), 1986, pp. 741-763), the former is shown to maintain good flux surfaces up to the equilibrium β-limit predicted by ideal-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), above which a separatrix forms. The latter, which has no ideal equilibrium β-limit, is shown to develop regions of magnetic islands and chaos at sufficiently high β, thereby providing a 'non-ideal β-limit'. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the value of β at which the Shafranov shift of the axis reaches a fraction of the minor radius follows in all cases the scaling laws predicted by ideal-MHD. We compare our results to the High-Beta-Stellarator theory of Freidberg (Ideal MHD, 2014, Cambridge University Press) and derive a new prediction for the non-ideal equilibrium β-limit above which chaos emerges.},

It is shown that the variational principle of multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics (MRxMHD) can be used to predict the stability and nonlinear saturation of tearing modes in strong guide field configurations without resolving the dynamics and without explicit dependence on the plasma resistivity. While the magnetic helicity is not a good invariant for tearing modes, we show that the saturated tearing mode can be obtained as an MRxMHD state of a priori unknown helicity by appropriately constraining the current profile.

  abstract = {(abridged) Magnetic reconnection is the topological reconfiguration of the magnetic field in a plasma, accompanied by the violent release of energy and particle acceleration. Reconnection is as ubiquitous as plasmas themselves, with solar flares perhaps the most popular example. Over the last few years, the theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in large-scale fluid systems has undergone a major paradigm shift. The steady-state model of reconnection described by the famous Sweet-Parker (SP) theory, which dominated the field for \textasciitilde 50 years, has been replaced with an essentially time-dependent, bursty picture of the reconnection layer, dominated by the continuous formation and ejection of multiple secondary islands (plasmoids). Whereas in the SP model reconnection was predicted to be slow, a major implication of this new paradigm is that reconnection in fluid systems is fast (i.e., independent of the Lundquist number), provided that the system is large enough. This conceptual shift hinges on the realization that SP-like current layers are violently unstable to the plasmoid instability - implying, therefore, that such current sheets are super-critically unstable and thus can never form in the first place. This suggests that the formation of a current sheet and the subsequent reconnection process cannot be decoupled, as is commonly assumed. This paper provides an introductory-level overview of the recent developments in reconnection theory and simulations that led to this essentially new framework. We briefly discuss the role played by the plasmoid instability in selected applications, and describe some of the outstanding challenges that remain at the frontier of this subject. Amongst these are the analytical and numerical extension of the plasmoid instability to (i) 3D and (ii) non-MHD regimes. New results are reported in both cases.},

  abstract = {The critical issue of divertor configuration for heat and particle flux control in a conceptual ARIES compact stellarator (CS) reactor is addressed. The goal is to determine a divertor location and geometry with a peak heat load of not more than 10 MW/m2 for a CS equilibrium based on the configuration to be used in the NCSX experiment, optimized for high beta (6.4\%) and designed for low alpha-particle power loss fraction (Յ5\%). The surface heat flux on the target has three components: thermal particles, lost energetic alphas, and radiation from the core and the scrape-off layer. The first two components are dominant and their magnitudes can be comparable. To maintain a tritium-breeding ratio of 1.1, the total target area should not exceed 15\% of the boundary plasma surface area. The divertor concept consists of two pairs of target plates per field period, one pair each at the top and bottom of the plasma. The heat flux profile is assessed by assuming that the parallel transport can be represented by field line mapping and that cross-field transport can be modeled with a prescribed field line diffusion scheme. In this manner, the poloidal and toroidal extents of the plates and their shape and distance to the plasma are designed to intercept all the heat flux and to minimize the peak thermal heat load. An approximate scheme, based on particle drift orbits in the core and field line tracing in the edge, is derived to estimate the alpha-particle heat load distribution over the plates and the first wall. The best plate configuration to date yields total peak heat loads (thermal ϩ alpha) ranging from 5 to 18 MW/m2. Further optimization of the target plates is required to reach the design goal, which will be addressed in a future study.},

The boundary conditions allow the magnetic fields on either side of the discontinuity surface to be described by surface magnetic potentials, reducing the continuation problem to that of solving a Hamilton–Jacobi equation. The characteristics of this equation obey Hamiltonian equations of motion, and a necessary condition for the existence of a continued field across a general toroidal surface is that there exist invariant tori in the phase space of this Hamiltonian system. It is argued from the Birkhoff theorem that existence of such an invariant torus is also, in general, sufficient for continuation to be possible. An important corollary is that the rotational transform of the continued field on a surface of discontinuity must, generically, be irrational.},

The new code, called flexible optimized curves in space using automatic differentiation (AD) and finite build (FOCUSADD), performs gradient-based optimization in a high-dimensional, non-convex space. The derivatives with respect to parameters of finite-build coils are easily and efficiently computed using AD. FOCUSADD parametrizes coil positions in free space using a Fourier series and uses a multi-filament approximation to the coil winding pack. The orientation of the winding pack is parametrized with a Fourier series and can be optimized as well. Optimized finite-build coils for a Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)-like stellarator are found, and compared with filamentary coil results. The final positions of optimized finite-build W7-X-like coils are shifted, on average, by approximately 2.5 mm relative to optimized filamentary coils. These results suggest that finite-build effects should be accounted for in the optimization of stellarators with low coil tolerances.},

The energy utilization factor in existing devices is defined as f = PFusion/PLoss= (TneTL)/(TneTE)i; in experimental plasmas, f has increased by about two orders of magnitude in the past decade and now exceeds 10"4 (a "nearest" f* exceeds 10\textasciitilde 3). The f factor is also analogous to its fission counterpart in the four-factor neutron multiplication factor k = f rj e p, where f is the neutron thermal utilization factor. Past, present, and future fusion experiments are discussed briefly in this context.},

  abstract = {Symplectic maps are the discrete-time analog of Hamiltonian motion. They arise in many applications including accelerator, chemical, condensed-matter, plasma, and Quid physics. Twist maps correspond to Hamiltonians for which the velocity is a monotonic function of the canonical momentum. Twist maps have a Lagrangian variational formulation. One-parameter families of twist maps typically exhibit the full range of possible dynamics-from simple or integrable motion to complex or chaotic motion. One class of orbits, the minimizing orbits, can be found throughout this transition; the properties of the minimizing orbits are discussed in detail. Among these orbits are the periodic and quasiperiodic orbits, which form a scaffold in the phase space and constrain the motion of the remaining orbits. The theory of transport deals with the motion of ensembles of trajectories. The variational principle provides an efficient technique for computing the Aux escaping from regions bounded by partial barriers formed from minimizing orbits. Unsolved problems in the theory of transport include the explanation for algebraic tails in correlation functions, and its extension to maps of more than two dimensions.},

  abstract = {During the first operational phase (OP1) of the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator, poloidal magnetic field fluctuations, , were measured in several different plasma scenarios with a system of Mirnov coils. In the spectrograms, multiple frequency bands close together in frequency are observed below f = 600 kHz. Furthermore, a dominant feature is the appearance of a frequency band with the highest spectral amplitude centred between kHz. The fluctuations are observed from the beginning of most W7-X plasmas of OP1, which were often operated solely with electron cyclotron resonance heating. The fluctuations show characteristics known from Alfvén waves and possibly Alfvén eigenmodes (AEs). However, the fast particle drive from heating sources, which is generally a driver necessary for the appearance of AEs in magnetic confinement plasmas, is absent in most of the analysed experiments. A characterization of the Alfvénic fluctuations measured during OP1 plasmas is possible using a newly developed tracking algorithm. In this paper, we extensively survey the different spectral properties of the fluctuations in correlation with plasma parameters and discuss possible driving mechanisms. The correlation studies of the dynamics of the possible ellipticity induced AEs indicate that Alfvén activity in the frequency interval between kHz could be excited due to an interaction with turbulence, or profile effects also affecting the turbulence amplitude.},

For this purpose we use a system of tri-orthogonal coordinates tied to the magnetic axis, which is defined with the help of its own intrinsic co-ordinates: R(s) and T(s). The results of the equilibrium calculations show that all other things being equal, no further equilibrium is possible in general when the angle ιc0 of rotational transformation on the magnetic axis approaches a whole multiple of 2π. We give the developments of the physical quantities at equilibrium as far as the third order. We deduce from these properties a classification of toroidal equilibria, and some examples are treated. In the second part we study the stability of these equilibria in terms of localized displacements. The results indicate some regions of stabilities for configurations characterized by ι0c/2π≈k: A simple example of a straight stellarator is treated and furnished with conditions for equilibrium and stability characterized by some βc's of equilibrium and stability.},

  abstract = {The stellarator is a promising concept to produce energy from nuclear fusion by magnetically confining a high-pressure plasma. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) describes how plasma pressure, current density and magnetic field interact. In a stellarator, the confining field is three-dimensional, and the computational cost of solving the 3D MHD equations currently limits stellarator comprehension, exploration and optimization. Although data-driven approaches have been proposed to provide fast 3D MHD equilibria, the accuracy with which equilibrium properties are reconstructed is unknown. In this work, we describe an artificial neural network (NN) that quickly approximates the ideal-MHD solution operator in Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) configurations. This model fulfils equilibrium symmetries by construction. The MHD force residual regularizes the solution of the NN to satisfy the ideal-MHD equations. The model predicts the equilibrium solution with high accuracy, and it faithfully reconstructs global equilibrium quantities and proxy functions used in stellarator optimization. The regularization term enforces that the NN reduces the ideal-MHD force residual, and solutions that are better than ground truth equilibria can be obtained at inference time. We also optimize W7-X magnetic configurations, where competitive configurations can be found in terms of fast particle confinement. This work demonstrates with which accuracy NN models can approximate the 3D ideal-MHD solution operator and reconstruct equilibrium properties of interest, and it suggests how they might be used to optimize stellarator magnetic configurations.},

Methods: We developed a CyberKnife IGRT kV beam model in a standard treatment planning system and validated it against measurements in heterogeneous phantoms. Five brain, five head and neck, five thorax, and 10 (five male and five female) pelvis patient computed tomographies (CTs) were contoured. The dose distribution resulting from different CyberKnife IGRT protocols was calculated. From them, the effective dose was calculated according to ICRP publication Nr 103, using the average dose to contoured organs. The corresponding risk factors were calculated. Entrance surface dose (ESD) was also calculated and compared with existing data. Results: The maximum effective dose produced by CyberKnife IGRT protocols was 0.8~mSv (brain), 1.9~mSv (H\&N), 20.2 (pelvis), and 42.4~mSv (thorax) per fraction for a risk estimate of 0.004\% (brain), 0.01\% (H\&N), 0.1\% (pelvis), and 0.2\% (thorax). Calculated ESD were compatible with existing data. Conclusions: Dose calculation models for CyberKnife IGRT kV beams were implemented in a clinical treatment planning system and validated in water and heterogeneous phantoms. We determined the effective dose and the related risk estimate resulting from CyberKnife IGRT protocols for brain, head and neck, thorax, and pelvis cases. The effective doses calculated for CyberKnife IGRT protocols were similar to those obtained for cone beam CT protocols on conventional C-arm linear accelerators, except for extreme irradiation conditions for thorax cases (140~kV X-ray tube tension).},

  abstract = {The multiple-recycle fuel cycle for uranium-238 considered here, if practically realized, can bring revolutionary changes in nuclear energy. A full use of uranium-238 implies a practically infinite resource for power generation. Besides the energy, the fuel cycle net output is only fission products, which are co-products rather than waste. For the same amount of energy produced, the amount of fission products is two orders of magnitude less compared with the amount of spent nuclear fuel generated in currently exploited nuclear energy production scenarios. Using the simplest isotope balance model, key features of the multiple-recycle fuel cycle for uranium-238 are investigated. The repetition of this cycle results in smooth transformation of the initial fuel to ‘stationary’ fuel without strong variations in the fractional isotope content. Deficit of delayed neutrons is a threat of the fuel cycle considered as well as other fuel cycles that use plutonium. It has a dramatic impact on reactor controllability and safety. A solution to this threat could be a subcritical nuclear reactor with an external neutron source. In this paper, use of a stellarator–mirror (SM) fusion–fission hybrid for the multiple-recycle fuel cycle for uranium-238 is analysed. A summary of the experimental and theoretical studies on the SM hybrid is given. Preliminary results for principal design of a SM hybrid nuclear reactor for the multiple-recycle fuel cycle for uranium-238 are presented.},

The project's risks stemmed from its technical challenges, primarily the complex component geometries and tight tolerances that were required. The initial baseline, which was established in 2004, was supported by a risk management plan and risk-based contingencies, both of which proved to be inadequate. Technical successes were achieved in the construction of challenging components and subassemblies, but cost and schedule growth was experienced. As part of an effort to improve project performance, a new risk management program was devised and implemented in 2007-2008.

  abstract = {Abstract             In state-of-the-art stellarators, turbulence is a major cause of the degradation of plasma confinement. To maximize confinement, which eventually determines the amount of nuclear fusion reactions, turbulent transport needs to be reduced. Here we report the observation of a confinement regime in a stellarator plasma that is characterized by increased confinement and reduced turbulent fluctuations. The transition to this regime is driven by the injection of submillimetric boron powder grains into the plasma. With the line-averaged electron density being kept constant, we observe a substantial increase of stored energy and electron and ion temperatures. At the same time, the amplitude of the plasma turbulent fluctuations is halved. While lower frequency fluctuations are damped, higher frequency modes in the range between 100 and 200\,kHz are excited. We have observed this regime for different heating schemes, namely with both electron and ion cyclotron resonant radio frequencies and neutral beams, for both directions of the magnetic field and both hydrogen and deuterium plasmas.},

The design feature of Heliotron J is, as compared with that of Heliotron E, the reduced neoclassical transport (near the tokamak level according to the DKES code) and the enhanced average beta limit (4\% for the Mercier criterion) with small bootstrap current, which carries the potential for developing the currentless ‘quasi- isodynamic’ optimization. The device parameters are as follows: the major plasma radius of 1.2 m, the average plasma minor radius of 0.1–0.2 m, the magnetic field strength on the magnetic axis of 1.5 T, the vacuum rotational transform of 0.2–0.8 with a low magnetic shear, and the magnetic well depth of1.5\% at the plasma edge, with heating systems such as ECH(0.5 MW), NBI(1.5 MW), and ICRF(2.5 MW). The feasibility of the helical-axis heliotron concept and its ability to explore high-quality confinement surfaces with a divertor will be fully tested in Heliotron J. The first plasma was planned to be produced in the autumn of 1999.},

In this paper, pellet injection experiments are performed for several magnetic configurations of the TJ-II stellarator. The aim of this study is to increase the understanding of the role played by rational surfaces in plasmoid drift and deposition profiles in stellarators. The analysis of experimentally observed plasmoid drifts is supported by simulations of such cases made with the HPI2 code. Plasmoid drift is found to be significantly reduced, as in tokamaks, in the vicinity of rational surfaces. This is attributed to the fact that plasmoid external charge reconnection lengths are shorter near rational surfaces, resulting in a more effective damping of the plasmoid drift. Although the effect of plasmoid external currents on the drift is expected to be negligible in stellarators, compared with those caused by plasmoid internal currents, the effect observed in TJ-II is clearly measurable. In addition, simulations show that enhanced drift reductions near rational surfaces lead to significantly different deposition profiles for the magnetic configurations included in this study. This implies that it should be possible to select the magnetic configurations to obtain more efficient pellet fuelling.},

We obtain winding surfaces for W7-X and HSX which simultaneously decrease the normal magnetic field on the plasma surface and increase the surface-averaged distance between the coils and the plasma in comparison with the actual winding surfaces. The coils computed on the optimized surfaces feature a smaller toroidal extent and curvature and increased inter-coil spacing.

  abstract = {Given the large anisotropy of transport processes in magnetized plasmas, the magnetic field structure can strongly impact heat diffusion: magnetic surfaces and cantori form barriers to transport while chaotic layers and island structures can degrade confinement. When a small but non-zero amount of perpendicular diffusion is included, the structure of the magnetic field becomes less important, allowing pressure gradients to be supported across chaotic regions and island chains. We introduce a metric for the effective volume over which the local parallel diffusion dominates based on the solution to the anisotropic heat diffusion equation. To validate this metric, we consider model fields with a single island chain and a strongly chaotic layer for which analytic predictions of the relative parallel and perpendicular transport can be made. We also analyse critically chaotic fields produced from different sets of perturbations, highlighting the impact of the mode number spectrum on the heat transport. Our results indicate that this metric coincides with the effective volume of non-integrability in the limit κ⊥ → 0, where κ⊥ is the perpendicular diffusion coefficient. We propose that this metric be used to assess the impact of non-integrability on the heat transport in stellarator equilibria.},

  abstract = {Collisionless physics primarily determines the transport of fusion-born alpha particles in 3D equilibria. Several transport mechanisms have been implicated in stellarator configurations, including stochastic diffusion due to class transitions, ripple trapping, and banana drift-convective orbits. Given the guiding center dynamics in a set of six quasihelical and quasiaxisymmetric equilibria, we perform a classification of trapping states and transport mechanisms. In addition to banana drift convection and ripple transport, we observe substantial non-conservation of the parallel adiabatic invariant which can cause losses through diffusive banana tip motion. Furthermore, many lost trajectories undergo transitions between trapping classes on longer time scales, either with periodic or irregular behavior. We discuss possible optimization strategies for each of the relevant transport mechanisms. We perform a comparison between fast ion losses and metrics for the prevalence of mechanisms such as banana-drift convection (Velasco et al 2021 Nucl. Fusion 61 116059), transitioning orbits, and wide orbit widths. Quasihelical configurations are found to have natural protection against ripple-trapping and diffusive banana tip motion leading to a reduction in prompt losses.},

  abstract = {The rapidly emerging technology of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) opens new opportunities for the development of non-planar non-insulated HTS magnets. This type of HTS magnet offers attractive features via its simplicity and robustness, and is well suited for modest size steady-state applications such as a mid-scale stellarator. In non-planar coil applications the HTS tape may be subject to severe hard-way bending strain ( bend), torsional strains ( tor) and magnetic field components transverse to the HTS tape plane (B⊥), all of which can limit the magnet operating space. A novel method of winding angle optimization is here presented to overcome these limitations for fixed input non-planar coil filamentary geometry. Essentially, this method: (i) calculates the peak bend and B⊥ for arbitrary winding angle along an input coil filamentary trajectory, (ii) defines a cost function including both and then (iii) uses tensioned splines to define a winding angle that reduces tor and optimizes the bend and B⊥ cost function. As strain limits are present even without B⊥, this optimization is able to provide an assessment of the minimum buildable size of an arbitrary non-planar non-insulating HTS coil. This optimization finds that for standard 4 mm wide HTS tapes the minimum size coils of the existing HSX, NCSX and W7-X stellarator geometries are around 0.3–0.5 m in mean coil radius. Identifying the minimum size provides a path to specify a mid-scale stellarator capable of achieving high-field or high-temperature operation with minimal HTS tape length. For coils larger than this size, strain optimization allows use of wider (higher current capacity) HTS tapes or alternatively permitting a finite (yet tolerable) strain allows reduction of B⊥. Reduced B⊥ enables a reduction of the HTS tape length required to achieve a given design magnetic field or equivalently an increase in the achievable magnetic field for fixed HTS tape length. The distinct considerations for optimizing a stellarator coilset to further ease compatibility with non-insulated HTS magnets are also discussed, highlighting relaxed curvature limits and the introduction of limits to the allowable torsion.},

Here we show the first physics results, obtained before plasma operation: that the carefully tailored topology of nested magnetic surfaces needed for good confinement is realized, and that the measured deviations are smaller than one part in 100,000.

With a 30 cubic meter volume, a superconducting coil system operating at 2.5 T, and steady-state heating capability of eventually up to 10 MW, it was built to demonstrate the benefits of optimized stellarators at parameters approaching those of a fusion power plant. We report here on the first results with the test divertor installed, during the second operation phase, which was performed in the second half of 2017. Operation with a divertor, and the addition of several new fueling systems, allowed higher density operation in hydrogen as well as helium. The effects that higher density operation had on both divertor operation and global confinement will be described. In particular, at high densities detachment was observed, and the highest fusion triple product for a stellarator was achieved.},

Plasmas 18, 062504 (2011)] is a recently developed MHD equilibrium code designed to perform fast and accurate calculations of ideal MHD equilibria for three-dimensional magnetic configurations. Since SIESTA does not assume closed magnetic surfaces, the solution can exhibit magnetic islands and stochastic regions. In its original implementation SIESTA addressed only fixed-boundary problems. That is, the shape of the plasma edge, assumed to be a magnetic surface, was kept fixed as the solution iteratively converges to equilibrium. This condition somewhat restricts the possible applications of SIESTA. In this paper, we discuss an extension that will enable SIESTA to address free-plasma-boundary problems, opening up the possibility of investigating problems in which the plasma boundary is perturbed either externally or internally. As an illustration, SIESTA is applied to a configuration of the W7-X stellarator.},

Bootstrap currents in the range of tens of kAs can lead to the formation of unwanted magnetic island chains or stochastic regions within the plasma and alter the boundary rotational transform due to the small shear in W7-X. The latter issue is of relevance since the island divertor operation of W7-X relies on a proper positioning of magnetic island chains at the plasma edge to control the particle and energy exhaust towards the divertor plates. Two scenarios are examined with the new free-plasma-boundary capabilities of SIESTA: a freely evolving bootstrap current one that illustrates the difficulties arising from the dislocation of the boundary islands, and a second one in which off-axis electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) is applied to compensate the effects  of the bootstrap current and keep the island divertor configuration intact. SIESTA finds that off-axis ECCD is indeed able to keep the location and phase of the edge magnetic island chain unchanged, but it may also lead to an undesired stochastization of parts of the confined plasma if the EC deposition radial profile becomes too narrow.},

  abstract = {In the following theoretical and numerically oriented work, a number of findings have been assembled. The newly devised VENUS-LEVIS code, designed to accurately solve the motion of energetic particles in the presence of 3D magnetic fields, relies on a non-canonical general coordinate Lagrangian formulation of the guiding-centre and full-orbit equations of motion. VENUS-LEVIS can switch between guiding-centre and full-orbit equations with minimal discrepancy at first order in Larmor radius by verifying the perpendicular variation of magnetic vector field, not only including gradients and curvature terms but also parallel currents and the shearing of field-lines. By virtue of a Fourier representation of the fields in poloidal and toroidal coordinates and a cubic spline in the radial variable, the order of the Runge-Kutta integrating scheme is preserved and convergence of Hamiltonian properties is obtained. This interpolation scheme is crucial to compute orbits over slowing-down times, as well as to mitigate the singularity of the magnetic axis in toroidal flux coordinate systems. Three-dimensional saturated MHD states are associated with many tokamak phenomena including snakes and LLMs in spherical or more conventional tokamaks, and are inherent to stellarator devices. The VMEC equilibrium code conveniently reproduces such 3D magnetic configurations. Slowing-down simulations of energetic ions from NBI predict off-axis deposition of particles during LLM MHD activity in hybrid-like plasmas of the MAST. Co-passing particles helically align in the opposite side of the plasma deformation, whereas counter-passing and trapped particles are less affected by the presence of a helical core. Qualitative agreement is found against experimental measurements of the neutron emission. Two opposing approaches to include RMPs in fast ion simulations are compared, one where the vacuum field caused by the RMP current coils is added to the axisymmetric MHD equilibrium, the other where the MHD equilibrium includes the plasma response within the 3D deformation of its flux-surfaces. The first model admits large regions of stochastic field-lines that penetrate the plasma without alteration. The second assumes nested flux-surfaces with a single magnetic axis, embedding the RMPs in a 3D saturated ideal MHD state but excluding stochastic field-lines within the last closed flux-surface. Simulations of fast ion populations from NBI are applied to MAST n=3 RMP coil configuration with 4 different activation patterns. At low beam energies, particle losses are dominated by parallel transport due to the stochasticity of the field-lines, whereas at higher energies, losses are accredited to the 3D structure of the perturbed plasma as well as drift resonances},

  abstract = {The multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics (MRxMHD) has been successful in the construction of equilibria in three-dimensional (3D) configurations. In MRxMHD, the plasma is sliced into sub-volumes separated by ideal interfaces, each undergoing relaxation, allowing the formation of islands and chaos. The resulting equilibrium has a stepped pressure profile across sub-volumes. The stepped pressure equilibrium code (SPEC) (S R Hudson et al, Phys. Plasmas 19, 112502 (2012)) was developed to calculate MRxMHD equilibria numerically. In this work, we have extended the SPEC code to compute MRxMHD equilibria with field-aligned flow and rotation, following the theoretical development to incorporate cross-helicity and angular momentum constraints. The code has been verified for convergence and compared to a Grad–Shafranov solver in 2D. We apply our new tool to study the flow profile change before and after the sawtooth crash of a reversed-field pinch discharge, in which data of the parallel flow is available. We find the promising result that under the constraints of cross-helicity and angular momentum, the parallel flow profile in post-crash SPEC equilibrium is flat in the plasma core and the amplitude of the flow matches experimental observations. Finally, we provide an example equilibrium with a 3D helical field structure as the favoured lower energy state. This will be the first 3D numerical equilibrium in which the flow effects are self-consistently calculated.},

  abstract = {The numerical solution of the stepped pressure equilibrium (Hudson et al 2012 Phys. Plasmas 19 112502) requires a fast and robust solver to obtain the Beltrami field in three-dimensional geometry such as stellarators. The spectral method implemented in the stepped pressure equilibrium code (SPEC) is efficient when the domain is a hollow torus, but ill-conditioning of the discretised linear equations occurs in the (solid) toroid due to the artificially singular coordinate parameterisation near the axis. In this work, we propose an improved choice for the reference axis to prevent coordinates surfaces from overlapping. Then, we examine the parity and asymptotics of the magnetic vector potential near the axis and suggest the use of recombined and rescaled Zernike radial basis functions. The maximum relative error in the magnetic field of the Wendelstein 7-X geometry is shown to reach 10−9 at high resolution in a series of convergence tests and benchmarks against the boundary integral equation solver for Taylor states. The new method is also reported to significantly improve the accuracy of multi-volume SPEC calculations. A comparison between free-boundary SPEC and the analytical Dommaschk potential is presented with higher-than-usual Fourier resolution. It is illustrated that we are able to resolve low amplitude current sheets when an interface is placed where there is no flux surface in the analytic solution. This was previously concealed because of insufficient numerical resolution},

Plasmas 19 112502) has been successful in the construction of equilibria in 3D configurations that contain a mixture of flux surfaces, islands and chaotic magnetic field lines. In this model, the plasma is sliced into sub-volumes separated by ideal interfaces, and in each volume the magnetic field is a Beltrami field. In the cases where the system is far from possessing a continuous symmetry, such as in stellarators, the existence of solutions to a stepped-pressure equilibrium with given constraints, such as a multi-region relaxed MHD minimum energy state, is not guaranteed but is often taken for granted. Using SPEC, we have studied two different scenarios in which a solution fails to exist in a slab with analytic boundary perturbations. We found that with a large boundary perturbation, a certain interface becomes fractal, corresponding to the break up of a Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) surface. Moreover, an interface can only support a maximum pressure jump while a solution of the magnetic field consistent with the force balance condition can be found. An interface closer to break-up can support a smaller pressure jump. We discovered that the pressure jump can push the interface closer to being non-smooth through force balance, thus significantly decreasing the maximum pressure it can support. Our work shows that a convergence study must be performed on a SPEC equilibrium with interfaces close to break-up. These results may also provide insights into the choice of interfaces and have applications in finding out the maximum pressure a machine can support.},

Key engineering considerations include the size of the power core, access for maintenance, and the minimum distance required between the plasma and the coil to provide acceptable shielding and breeding. Our preferred power core option in a three-field-period configuration is a dual-coolant (He + Pb-17Li) ferritic steel modular blanket concept coupled with a Brayton power cycle and a port-based maintenance scheme. In parallel with a physics effort to help determine the location and peak heat load to the divertor, we developed a helium-cooled W alloy/ferritic steel divertor design able to accommodate 10 MW/m2. We also developed an intercoil structure design to accommodate the electromagnetic forces within each field period while allowing for penetrations required for maintenance, plasma control, coolant lines, and supporting legs for the in-vessel components. This paper summarizes the key engineering outcomes from the study. The engineering design of the fusion power core components (including the blanket and divertor) are described and key results from the supporting analyses presented, including stress analyses of the components and thermal-hydraulic analyses of the power core coupled to a Brayton cycle. The preferred port-based maintenance scheme is briefly described and the integration of the power core is discussed. The key stellarator-specific challenges affecting the design are highlighted, including the impact of the minimum plasma-coil distance, the maintenance, integration, and coil design requirements, and the need for alpha power accommodation.},

This is illustrated for a system consisting of a circular current loop and a straight current wire. An asymmetric configuration of the current system leads to three-dimensional spatially chaotic magnetic fields. The motion of charged particles in these fields is not necessarily chaotic and exhibits intriguing dynamical properties. Particles having initial velocities closely aligned with the direction of the local magnetic field are likely to follow chaotic orbits in phase space. Other particles follow coherent and periodic orbits; these orbits being the same as in the symmetric current configuration for which the field lines are not chaotic. An important feature of particles with chaotic motion is that they undergo spatial transport across magnetic field lines. The cross-field diffusion is of interest in a variety of magnetized plasmas including laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.},

Previous works comparing the widely used Sauter model with results of recently developed numerical neoclassical solvers have shown the Sauter model to be inaccurate at higher collisionalities typical of tokamak edge pedestals and in the presence of impurities. Thus, its applicability, particularly for the analysis of the highly interesting and highly complex plasma edge, is limited. For a revised set of analytical formulae, the procedure to determine the analytical formulae described by Sauter is repeated with the more accurate and more reliable numerical code NEO [E. Belli, Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 54, 015015 (2012)]. For the determination of the respective bootstrap current coefficient, the linearity of neoclassical transport is exploited. This new set of analytical formulae consists of the same analytical structure as the original set of analytical formulae published by Sauter [Phys. Plasmas 6, 2834 (1999); ibid. 9, 5140 (2002)] and also continues to use only three neoclassical key parameters: the fraction of trapped particles f trap, the collisionality ν σ*, and the effective charge number Z eff.},

The source of that disagreement has been investigated, and that investigation has led to new insights into the domain of validity of the different equilibrium calculations, and to a finding that the manner in which localized screening currents at low order rational surfaces are handled can affect global properties of the equilibrium solution. The perturbative treatment has been found to break down at surprisingly small perturbation amplitudes due to overlap of the calculated perturbed flux surfaces, and that treatment is not valid in the pedestal region of the DIII-D shot studied. The perturbative treatment is valid, however, further into the interior of the plasma, and flux surface overlap does not account for the disagreement investigated here. Calculated equilibrium solutions for simple model cases and comparison of the 3D equilibrium solutions with those of other codes indicate that the disagreement arises from a difference in handling of localized currents at low order rational surfaces, with such currents being absent in VMEC and present in the perturbative codes. The significant differences in the global equilibrium solutions associated with the presence or absence of very localized screening currents at rational surfaces suggests that it may be possible to extract information about localized currents from appropriate measurements of global equilibrium plasma properties. That would require improved diagnostic capability on the high field side of the tokamak plasma, a region difficult to access with diagnostics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The benefits of operating fusion devices, such as tokamaks and stellarators, at high fields make high-temperature superconducting magnets necessary to realize a compact fusion power system. Superconducting stellarators, such as W7-X, have used standard low-temperature superconductor technology (NbTi). ARPA-E has recently funded a 2-year project led by the startup Type One Energy and involving the Fusion Technology Institute at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, the Plasma Science to design and fabricat the first non-planar HTS (REBCO) coil for a high-field stellarator based on the SPARC tokamak’s VIPER cable concept. The design consists of a 1.5-turn non-planar REBCO coil supported by a pair of 3D printed stainless steel radial plates. The ultimate goals of the project are to determine if commercial REBCO tapes and additive manufacturing can be used to fabricate high field (≥ 10 T) non-planar coils with tight bending radii (≃ 100 mm) and with a degradation of the critical current smaller than 20 \% with respect to the expected performance. In this work we present numerical analysis for non-planar coils (critical current, magnetic field\&\#xD;map, Lorentz forces and quench aspects) at the operating conditions of 77 K and 20 K and the fabrication and testing in liquid nitrogen (77 K) of the first two non-planar demonstrators for stellarators based on a VIPER cable. The first demonstrator is a short NOn-planar VIPER cabLe (cable demonstrator at which we will refer to as (NOVEL) equipped with 100 HTS REBCO tapes and with a critical current of 5700 A at 77 K (self-field); the second is a MultIple turns (1.5-turns) NOn-plANar coil (coil demonstrator at which we will refer to as MINOAN) equipped with 30 HTS tapes and with a critical current of 2100 A at 77 K (self-field). Both demonstrators were tested at 77 K (liquid nitrogen bath) and the results showed that - even after being bent into non-planar shapes with bend radii ≃ 100 mm - the degradation of the critical current Ic was within 15 \%, meeting the expected goals of the project.},

  abstract = {The benefits of operating fusion devices, such as tokamaks and stellarators, at high fields make high-temperature superconducting magnets necessary to realize a compact fusion power system. Superconducting stellarators, such as W7-X, have used standard low-temperature superconductor technology niobium-titanium. ARPA-E has recently funded a two-year project led by the startup Type One Energy and involving the Fusion Technology Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Plasma Science to design and fabricate the first non-planar high-temperature superconductor (HTS) rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) coil for a high-field stellarator based on the SPARC tokamak’s VIPER cable concept. The design consists of a 1.5-turn non-planar REBCO coil supported by a pair of 3D printed stainless steel radial plates. The ultimate goals of the project are to determine if commercial REBCO tapes and additive manufacturing can be used to fabricate high field (⩾10 T) non-planar coils with tight bending radii (≃100 mm) and with a degradation of the critical current smaller than 20\% with respect to the expected performance. In this work we present numerical analysis for non-planar coils (critical current, magnetic field map, Lorentz forces and quench aspects) at the operating conditions of 77 K and 20 K and the fabrication and testing in liquid nitrogen (77 K) of the first two non-planar demonstrators for stellarators based on a VIPER cable. The first demonstrator is a short NOn-planar VIPER cabLe (cable demonstrator at which we will refer to as NOVEL) equipped with 100 HTS REBCO tapes and with a critical current of 5700 A at 77 K (self-field); the second is a MultIple turns (1.5-turns) NOn-plANar coil (coil demonstrator at which we will refer to as MINOAN) equipped with 30 HTS tapes and with a critical current of 2100 A at 77 K (self-field). Both demonstrators were tested at 77 K (liquid nitrogen bath) and the results showed that—even after being bent into non-planar shapes with bend radii ≃100 mm—the degradation of the critical current Ic was within 15\%, meeting the expected goals of the project.},

Without any assumption regarding the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium of the plasma, conditions for quasisymmetry are constructed starting from the single-particle Lagrangian to the leading order. The conditions presented in the paper are less restrictive than the set recently obtained by Burby et al. [“Some mathematics for quasi-symmetry,” arXiv:1912.06468 (2019)], and could facilitate ongoing efforts toward investigating the existence of global quasisymmetric MHD equilibria. It is also shown that quasisymmetry implies the existence of flux surfaces, regardless of whether the field corresponds to an MHD equilibrium.},

This analytic consideration provides important insight on the dependence of the bounce-averaged drift on the geometry and stability properties of the field. In particular, we show that although the maximum-J\textbackslash mathcal \{J\} property is unattainable in quasisymmetric stellarators, one may approach it through increased plasma ��β\textbackslash beta and triangular shaping, albeit going through a reduced precession scenario with potentially higher particle losses. The description of trapped particles allows us to calculate the available energy of trapped electrons analytically in two asymptotic regimes, providing insight into the behaviour of this measure of turbulence. It is shown that the available energy is intimately related to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) stability, providing a potential synergy between this measure of gyrokinetic turbulence and MHD stability.},

  abstract = {The engineering current density in YBCO coated conductor applications can be improved in two ways. Either the critical current density should be improved or the superconducting films made thicker. Unfortunately, it has often been observed that the average critical current density decreases when the thickness of films increases. Suggested reasons for this behaviour include e.g. two dimensional pinning properties, microcracks and imperfect crystallographic alignment. However, it is often forgotten that the self-field effect unavoidably reduces the critical current density when the thickness of YBCO films increases and thereby total current rises. In this paper, the influence of self-field on the average critical current density is studied computationally as a function of film thickness. The situation is also scrutinized at different external magnetic fields in order to find ways to distinguish self-field effects from problems related to the manufacturing process. For this purpose, critical current measurements in external field perpendicular to the film surface are proposed.},

  abstract = {Divertor systems of fusion devices are exposed to intense heat loads from plasmas, which degrade solid plasma-facing components. Fast liquid metal (LM) flow divertors may be more advantageous for this purpose but have risk of piling due to intense magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) drag. However, severe deceleration of the flow could be countered with the injection of currents that are transverse to external magnetic fields, allowing to thrust the flow with (Lorentz) forces. Given that the injection of currents as an approach to propel LM-divertor flows has remained experimentally understudied, this article focuses on the evaluation of -thrust and finding its drawbacks. -thrust was experimentally tested with free-surface-LM flows, a vertical magnetic field and an externally applied current. Experiments were reviewed with a theoretical model, showing agreement in the trends of theory and experiments. Full 3D-MHD-free-surface-flow simulations were also performed with FreeMHD and confirmed the sensitivity to unstable flow behavior in LM systems when applying external currents. Furthermore, excessive power requirements are expected for the implementation of -thrust at the reactor scale, making these systems inefficient for commercial devices. This paper evidences that the simple operation of a LM-flow divertor with -thrust, without any of the instabilities caused from reactor plasmas or parasitic currents, already presents intrinsic challenges.},

This beta value was instantaneously obtained by pellet injection and maintained for more than 10τE, whereas the steady-state plasma with a maximum 〈βdia〉 of 4.8\% was sustained for 85τE by gas-puff fueling. While it is theoretically predicted that stochastization of the peripheral magnetic field structure develops with an increment of 〈βdia〉, no serious degradation of the global confinement has been observed in the present 〈β dia〉 range. The several low-order MHD activities located in the periphery were enhanced with the beta value and sometimes affect the local profiles. The amplitude of the mode in the periphery strongly depends on the magnetic Reynolds number, which is close to that of the growth rate and/or the radial mode width of the resistive interchange instability. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {The bootstrap current for three electron cyclotron resonance heated plasma scenarios in a quasihelically symmetric stellarator (the Helically Symmetric Experiment) are analyzed and compared to a neoclassical transport code PENTA. The three conditions correspond to 50 kW input power with a resonance that is off-axis, 50 kW on-axis heating and 100 kW on-axis heating. When the heating location was moved from off-axis to on-axis with 50 kW heating power, the stored energy and the extrapolated steady-state current were both observed to increase. When the on-axis heating power was increased from 50 kW to 100 kW, the stored energy continued to increase while the bootstrap current slightly decreased. This trend is qualitatively in agreement with the calculations which indicate that a large positive electric field for the 100 kW case was driving the current negative in a small region close to the magnetic axis and accounting for the decrease in the total integrated current. This trend in the calculations is only observed to occur when momentum conservation between particle species is included. Without momentum conservation, the calculated bootstrap current increases monotonically. We show that the magnitude of the bootstrap current as calculated by PENTA agrees better with the experiment when momentum conservation between plasma species is included in the calculation. The total current was observed in all cases to flow in a direction to unwind the transform, unlike in a tokamak in which the bootstrap current adds to the transform. The 3-D inductive response of the plasma is simulated to predict the evolution of the current profile during the discharge. The 3-D equilibrium reconstruction code V3FIT is used to reconstruct profiles of the plasma pressure and current constrained by measurements with a set of magnetic diagnostics. The reconstructed profiles are consistent with the measured plasma pressure profile and the simulated current profile when the reconstruction is constrained by the measured data from a diagnostic array that is internal to the vacuum chamber.},

  abstract = {Quasisymmetry (QS) is a hidden symmetry of the magnetic field strength, B, that confines charged particles effectively in a nonsymmetric toroidal plasma equilibrium. Recent numerical breakthroughs have shown that excellent QS can be realized in a toroidal volume. Here, we show that the hidden symmetry of QS has a deep connection to the underlying symmetry that makes solitons possible. In particular, we demonstrate that a class of quasisymmetric B is described by a periodic finite-gap soliton potential of the well-known Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. Our exact and non-perturbative method drastically reduces the number of independent B parameters on a magnetic flux surface to just three, which could make stellarator optimization schemes significantly more efficient. Furthermore, we deduce an upper bound on the maximum toroidal volume that can be quasisymmetric. In the neighborhood of the outermost surface, B approaches the form of the 1-soliton reflectionless potential.},

  abstract = {Turbulent transport is known to limit the plasma confinement of present-day optimized stellarators. To address this issue, a novel method to strongly suppress turbulence in such devices is proposed, namely the resonant wave-particle interaction of suprathermal particles-e.g., from ion-cyclotron-resonance-frequency heating-with turbulence-driving microinstabilities like ion-temperature-gradient modes. The effectiveness of this mechanism is demonstrated via large-scale gyrokinetic simulations, revealing an overall turbulence reduction by up to 65\% in the case under consideration. Comparisons with a tokamak configuration highlight the critical role played by the magnetic geometry and the first steps into the optimization of fast particle effects in stellarator devices are discussed. These results hold the promise of new and still unexplored stellarator scenarios with reduced turbulent transport, essential for achieving burning plasmas in future devices.},

  abstract = {The equilibrium plasma rotation in a general toroidal magnetic field is nearly always subsonic and is determined by the requirement that the collisional particle transport should be ambipolar in lowest order in the small-ion-gyroradius expansion. Only in quasi-symmetric fields, where collisional particle transport is intrinsically ambipolar, can the plasma rotate freely and then only in the quasi-symmetry direction. Sonic rotation velocities are allowed in this case. In this paper the effect of rotation in a quasi-axisymmetric field is investigated, and it is found that the symmetry is broken when the rotation speed exceeds the diamagnetic speed appreciably, leading to reappearance of the non-intrinsically ambipolar 1/ν-transport regime. Fortunately, this transport scales with the fourth power of the rotation Mach number and is expected to be modest in most plasmas of interest.},

Existing stellarator coil optimization codes ultimately produce zero-thickness filament coils. However, stellarator coils have finite depth and thickness, which can make the single-filament model a poor approximation, particularly when coil build dimensions are relatively large compared to the coil–plasma distance. In this paper, we present a new method for designing coils with finite builds and present a mechanism to optimize the orientation of the winding pack. We approximate finite-build coils with a multi-filament model. A numerical implementation has been developed, and applications to the Helically Symmetric eXperiment stellarator and a new UW-Madison quasihelically symmetric configuration are shown.},

  abstract = {The affordable, robust, compact (ARC) reactor is the product of a conceptual design study aimed at reducing the size, cost, and complexity of a combined fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) and demonstration fusion Pilot power plant. ARC is a ∼200-250 MWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3 m, a minor radius of 1.1 m, and an on-axis magnetic field of 9.2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable disassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating first wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many vacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma fusion gain of Q{$<$}inf{$>$}p{$<$}/inf{$>$} ≈ 13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap fraction of only ∼63\%. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large external control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is enabled by the ∼23 T peak field on coil achievable with newly available REBCO superconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative inboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13.6 MW of ion cyclotron fast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust, steady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid blanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium (FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides effective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a tritium breeding ratio ≥ 1.1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is liquid permits an output blanket temperature of 900 K, single phase fluid cooling, and a high efficiency helium Brayton cycle, which allows for net electricity generation when operating ARC as a Pilot power plant.},

  abstract = {Taylor's theory of relaxed toroidal plasmas (states of lowest energy with fixed total magnetic helicity) is extended to include a vacuum between the plasma and the wall. In the extended variational problem, one prescribes, in addition to the helicity and the magnetic fluxes whose conservation follows from the perfect conductivity of the wall, the fluxes whose conservation follows from the assumption that the plasma-vacuum interface is also perfectly conducting (if the wall is a magnetic surface, then one has the toroidal and the poloidal flux in the vacuum). Vanishing of the first energy variation implies a pressureless free-boundary magnetohydrostatic equilibrium with a Beltrami magnetic field in the plasma, and in general with a surface current in the interface. Positivity of the second variation implies that the equilibrium is stable according to ideal magnetohydrodynamics, that it is a relaxed state according to Taylor's theory if the interface is replaced by a wall, and that the surface current is nonzero (at least if there are no closed magnetic field lines in the interface). The plane slab, with suitable boundary conditions to simulate a genuine torus, is investigated in detail. The relaxed state has the same double symmetry as the vessel if, and only if, the prescribed helicity is in an interval that depends on the prescribed fluxes. This interval is determined in the limit of a thin slab.},

The edge magnetic structure in the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) and Wendelstein 7X (W7-X) stellarators has been shown to have a significant impact on the particle fueling and exhaust of the plasma main species (hydrogen) as well as impurity helium. For HSX, the plasma sourcing to exhaust ratio, quantified by the effective and global particle confinement times s Ã p and s p;H , respectively, increases when a magnetic island chain is located in the plasma edge. The fueling efficiency is reduced by 25\% when the plasma boundary is deformed by the magnetic islands. The X-point geometry also yields higher plasma temperatures in front of the main recycling region. When the island is moved radially inward, both s Ã p and s p decrease by 10\%-25\% depending on plasma density. The s p;H results rely heavily on EMC3-EIRENE modeling which confirms reduced fueling efficiency due to more rapid ionization in the outward shifted island position. These findings suggest that for a helically optimized system like HSX, the plasma fueling from the recycling source, as well as from active gas injection, can be controlled by the magnetic island chain in the plasma edge-which is a basic requirement for a divertor system. This process is also effective for the control of effective helium exhaust times, as s Ã p;He measured by perturbative gas puff experiments is reduced by up to 40\% when the islands are shifted inwards. For Wendelstein 7-X, a similar reduction of s Ã p;He was inferred when magnetic islands were moved from the far plasma edge into the confined plasma region. However, the effective confinement features of H as the main plasma species were not affected due to the non-optimal position of the magnetic islands with respect to the highly localized ionization domain during the limiter startup campaign.

These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with the mathematical theory.Richly illustrated, and with many exercises and worked examples, this book is ideal for an introductory course at the junior/senior or first-year graduate level.

  abstract = {This study deals with the equilibrium beta limit for high-beta plasmas of the Large Helical Device using a 3D equilibrium calculation code, HINT, which is an initial value solver based on the relaxation method without an assumption of nested flux surfaces. For the finite beta equilibrium, due to the nonlinear 3D equilibrium response, the flux surface breaking begins, and the magnetic field line becomes stochastic in the peripheral region. However, although the magnetic axis shifts until the conventional theoretical beta limit, the separatrix limiting the equilibrium does not appear in the plasma core. For the high beta equilibrium, breaking of the force balance begins in the strongly stochastized region. To keep the force balance in that region, the pressure gradient decreases and the fixed profile is relaxed. As a result, the volume averaged beta, which is equivalent to the plasma stored energy, saturates, although the peak beta increases. The beta value, where the force balance begins breaking in the inside of the stochastic region, is proposed as a new index of the equilibrium beta limit for the typical heliotron-type stellarator. According to this new index of the equilibrium beta limit, the achieved beta value in the experiment of the Large Helical Device is still lower than the equilibrium beta limit. This suggests that if the heating power can be increased, the achieved beta value may still increase.},

This process involves reconnection of magnetic field lines in a manner that destroys all the topological invariants of ideal plasma so that only total magnetic helicity survives. Although this mechanism, and the equations describing the relaxed state, are similar in all systems, the properties of the relaxed state depend crucially on the topology—toroidal or spherical—of the container and on the boundary conditions. Consequently there are several different types of relaxed state, each with its own special characteristics, which are derived and discussed. The measurements made on many experiments, including toroidal pinches, OHTE, multipinch, and spheromaks, are reviewed and shown to be in striking agreement with the theoretical predictions.},

  abstract = {Significant reductions in the size and cost of a fusion power plant core can be realized if simultaneous improvements in the energy replacement time, , and the plasma pressure or beta, can be achieved in steady-state conditions with high self-driven, bootstrap current fraction. Significant recent progress has been made in experimentally achieving these high performance regimes and in developing a theoretical understanding of the underlying physics. Three operational scenarios have demonstrated potential for steady-state high performance, the radiative improved mode, the high internal inductance or high scenario, and the negative central magnetic shear, NCS (or reversed shear) scenario. In a large number of tokamaks, reduced ion thermal transport to near neoclassical values, and reduced particle transport have been observed in the region of negative or very low magnetic shear: the transport reduction is consistent with stabilization of microturbulence by sheared flow. There is strong temporal and spatial correlation between the increased sheared flow, the reduction in the measured turbulence, and the reduction in transport. The DIII-D tokamak, the JET tokamak and the JT-60U tokamak have all observed significant increases in plasma performance in the NCS operational regime. Strong plasma shaping and broad pressure profiles, provided by the H-mode edge, allow high beta operation, consistent with theoretical predictions; and normalized beta values up to simultaneously with confinement enhancement over L-mode scaling, , have been achieved in the DIII-D tokamak. In the JT-60U tokamak, deuterium discharges with negative central magnetic shear have reached equivalent breakeven conditions, .},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This review reports on past and present R\&D on HTS cables and conductors for high field tokamaks, accelerator dipoles, and large solenoids. Among the HTS wires and tapes available commercially, coated conductor tapes are the most appealing because of their outstanding critical strength and future improvement margin. Limitations are the weakness against peeling and delamination and the short piece length. The prices of technical superconductors are reviewed because they play an important role in large projects; moreover HTS wires and tapes are discussed from the perspective of industrial production considering the historical development of the LTS wire market. Various designs have been proposed for HTS cables and conductors: some are better suited for soft materials, while others can exploit the anisotropy of coated conductors (by aligning the tape with the field), thus providing the highest current density. Recently, there has been an increase in the size and complexity of the prototypes; however some peculiar features of HTS, such as high stability margins and high mechanical limits, have not yet been fully incorporated into the designs: for example the transposition requirements for HTS have not yet been studied in detail. There are elements indicating that rectangular wires and tapes (even if anisotropic) can be used for manufacturing cables and magnets of any size and have advantages with respect to round wires.},

Fluids B 4, 2081 (1992)] has demonstrated the feasibility of modular coils and has pioneered the island divertor and the modeling of its three-dimensional characteristics with the EMC3/EIRENE code [Y. Feng, F. Sardei, Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 44, 611 (2002)]. It has extended the operational range to high density (4× 1020 m-3 at 2.5 T) and high 〈Β〉 (3.4\% at 0.9 T); it has demonstrated successfully the application of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) beyond cutoff via electron Bernstein wave heating, and it has utilized the toroidal variation of the magnetic field strength for ion cyclotron resonance frequency beach-wave heating. In preparation of W7-X [J. Nührenberg, Trans. Fusion Technol. 27, 71 (1995)], aspects of the optimization concept of the magnetic design have been successfully tested. W7-AS has accessed the H-mode, the first time in a "non-tokamak" and has extended H-mode operation toward high density by the discovery of the high-density H-mode (HDH), characterized by H-mode energy and L-mode-level impurity confinement. In the HDH-mode quasisteady state operation is possible close to operational limits without noticeable degradation in the plasma properties. High- Β phases up to tpulse τE =65 have been achieved, which can already be taken as an indication of the intrinsic stellarator capability of steady-state operation. Confinement issues will be discussed with emphasis on the similarities to tokamak confinement (general transport properties, H-mode transition physics) but also with respect to distinct differences (no confinement degradation toward operational boundaries, positive density scaling, lack of profile resilience, no distinct isotope effect, H-mode operational window). W7-AS turned out to be an important step in the development of the Wendelstein stellarator line towards an independent fusion power plant concept. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {This work examines bootstrap current in quasi-symmetric stellarators with a focus on the impact of boot-strap current on the equilibrium properties of stellarator configurations. In the design of the Quasi-Poloidal Stellarator (QPS), a code was used to predict the bootstrap current based on a calculation in an asymptotically collisionless limit. This calculation is believed to be a good approximation of the bootstrap current for low-collisionality plasmas but is expected to be higher than the actual bootstrap current for more collisional plasmas. A fluid moments approach has been developed to self-consistently calculate viscosities and neoclassical transport coefficients. The viscosities and transport coefficients can be used to calculate the bootstrap current for arbitrary collisionality and magnetic geometry. The bootstrap current calculations from the two codes were done for low-density, electron cyclotron-heated (ECH) plasmas and high-density, ion cyclotron-heated (ICH) plasmas for a range of configurations, and provide a benchmark for the moments code and a test of the range of validity of the collisionless code. In the configurations examined here, namely, QPS, the National Compact Stellarator Experiment, the Helically Symmetric Experiment, the Large Helical Device, and the Wendelstein-7X Stellarator, the bootstrap currents predicted from the two codes agree qualitatively for both ICH and ECH profiles.},

Finally, combining a dimensionless parameter approach with an empirical energy confinement time scaling, the necessary development steps are highlighted. From this analysis it is concluded that an intermediatestep burning-plasma stellarator is the most prudent approach to bridge the gap between W7-X and a HELIAS power plant. Using a systems code approach in combination with transport simulations, a range of possible conceptual designs is analysed. This range is exemplified by two bounding cases, a fast-track, cost-efficient device with low magnetic field and without a blanket and a device similar to a demonstration power plant with blanket and net electricity power production.},

The LHD machine is treated as a standard configuration heliotron with an L = 2 planar axis. The effects of vacuum magnetic configurations, pressure profiles and the vertical field control method are studied. The equilibrium beta limit with consistent bootstrap current is quite sensitive to the magnetic axis location for finite beta, compared with the currentless cases. For a vacuum configuration with the magnetic axis shifted inwards in the torus, even in the high beta regimes, the bootstrap current flows to increase the rotational transform, leading to an increase in the equilibrium beta limit. On the contrary, for a vacuum configuration with the magnetic axis shifted outwards in the torus, even in the low beta regimes, the bootstrap current flows so as to reduce the rotational transform; therefore, there is an acceleration of the Shafranov shift increase as beta increases, leading to a decrease in the equilibrium beta limit. The pressure profiles and vertical field control methods influence the equilibrium beta limit through the location of the magnetic axis for finite beta. These characteristics are independent of both device parameters, such as magnetic field strength, and device size in the low collisional regime.},

The two effects of the finite beta on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) configuration, the magnetic surface torus outward shift and the invasion of the stochastic region into the plasma core, are discussed. The former is qualitatively the same as that by the external vertical field control. According to the comparison between a theoretical prediction in the finite beta and the vacuum field calculation in the vertical field control, the latter effect is strongly affected by the nonaxisymmetric component of the equilibrium current. A theoretical prediction suggests that an MHD equilibrium beta limit different from the conventional one exists due to the lack of the equilibrium force balance in the stochastic region. The key parameters to improve the accuracy of the identification of the MHD equilibrium configuration are shown to be the identification of the toroidal current profile, the anisotropic pressure effect, and the identification of the plasma boundary shape.},

The corresponding stochastic optimization problems are formulated using a risk-neutral approach and risk-averse approaches. We present an efficient, gradient-based descent algorithm which relies on analytical derivatives to solve these problems. In a comprehensive numerical study, we compare the coil designs resulting from deterministic and risk-neutral stochastic optimization and find that the risk-neutral formulation results in more robust configurations and reduces the number of local minima of the optimization problem. We also compare deterministic and risk-neutral approaches in terms of quasi-symmetry on and away from the magnetic axis, and in terms of the confinement of particles released close to the axis. Finally, we show that for the optimization problems we consider, a risk-averse objective using the conditional value-at-risk leads to results which are similar to the risk-neutral objective.},

  abstract = {An alternative representation of an ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium is developed. The representation is a variation of one given by A. Salat, Phys. Plasmas 2, 1652 (1995). The system of equations is used to study the possibility of non-symmetric equilibria in a topological torus, here an approximate rectangular parallelopiped, with periodicity in two of the three rectangular coordinates. An expansion is carried out in the deviation of pressure surfaces from planes. Resonances are manifest in the process. Nonetheless, provided the magnetic shear is small, it is shown that it is possible to select the magnetic fields and flux surfaces in such a manner that no singularities appear on resonant surfaces. One boundary surface of the parallelopiped is not arbitrary but is dependent on the equilibrium in question. A comparison of the solution sets of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric equilibria suggests that the latter have a wider class of possible boundary shapes but more restrictive rotational transform profiles. No proof of convergence of the series is given. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Paul, PRL 128, 035001, 2022], demonstrating that precise quasihelical symmetry can be achieved with realistic coils. Several constraints are placed on the shape and spacing of the coils, such as low curvature and sufficient plasma-coil distance for neutron shielding. The coils resulting from this optimization have a maximum curvature 0.8 times that of the coils of the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) and a mean squared curvature 0.4 times that of the HSX coils when scaled to the same plasma minor radius. When scaled up to reactor size and magnetic field strength, no fast particle losses were found in the free-boundary configuration when simulating 5000 alpha particles launched at 3.5 MeV on the flux surface with normalized toroidal flux of s=0.5. An analysis of the tolerance of the coils to manufacturing errors is performed using a Gaussian process model, and the coils are found to maintain low particle losses for smooth, large-scale errors up to amplitudes of about 0.15 m. Another coil optimization is performed for the Landreman-Paul configuration with the additional constraint that the coils are purely planar. Visual inspection of the Poincar\textbackslash 'e plot of the resulting magnetic field-lines reveal that the planar modular coils alone do a poor job of reproducing the target equilibrium. Additional non-planar coil optimizations are performed for the quasihelical configuration with 5\% volume-averaged plasma beta from [M. Landreman, S. Buller, M. Drevlak, PoP 29, 082501, 2022], and a similar configuration also optimized to satisfy the Mercier criterion. The finite beta configurations had larger fast-particle losses, with the free-boundary Mercier-optimized configuration performing the worst, losing about 5.5\% of alpha particles launched at s=0.5.},

The main features of advanced stellarators are the optimized coil system which can be extrapolated to reactor size, improved properties of plasma equilibrium with reduced Shafranov shift and a stability limit which is sufficient to meet the requirements of a commercial fusion reactor. The key element to achieve these goals is the proper shape of the magnetic surfaces and minimization of the geodesic curvature of magnetic field lines. As a consequence, Pfirsch-Schlüter currents and radial particle transport are reduced. Neoclassical transport becomes small enough so that ignition is not endangered. The theoretical basis of the advanced stellarator is a systematic procedure to compute plasma equilibria with reduced Pfirsch-Schlüter currents. The close relation between neoclassical transport and viscous damping indicates that a reduction of geodesic curvature not only reduces radial transport but also leads to a reduction of viscous damping, and thus, facilitates the rotational spin-up of the plasma. For this reason achievement of shear flow and reduced anomalous transport may be expected in advanced stellarators. The paper discusses the various aspects of advanced stellarators and describes their basic properties.},

  abstract = {Small-amplitude, symmetry-breaking magnetic field perturbations, including resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) and error fields, can profoundly impact plasma properties in both tokamaks and stellarators. In this work, we perform the first comparison between the Stepped Pressure Equilibrium Code (SPEC) (a comparatively fast and efficient equilibrium code based on energy-minimisation principles) and M3D-C1 (a high-fidelity albeit computationally expensive initial-value extended-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code) to assess the conditions under which SPEC can be used to model the nonlinear, non-ideal plasma response to an externally applied (m = 2, n = 1) RMP field in an experimentally relevant geometry. We find that SPEC is able to capture the plasma response in the weakly nonlinear regime – meaning perturbation amplitudes below the threshold for break up of the separatrix and onset of secondary magnetic island formation – when around half of the total toroidal flux is enclosed in the volume containing the q = 2 resonant surface. The observed dependence of SPEC solutions on input parameters, including toroidal flux and the number of volumes into which the plasma is partitioned, indicates that additional exploration of the underlying Multi-Region Relaxed MHD physics model is needed to constrain the choice of parameters. Nonetheless, this work suggests promising applications of SPEC to optimisation and fusion plasma design.},

By comparing the shapes along a chaotic trajectory to those of the periodic orbits, state space persistence analysis quantifies the geometric similarities of chaotic trajectory segments and the periodic orbits. We demonstrate the method by applying it to the three-dimensional R\textbackslash "\{o\}ssler system and a thirty-dimensional discretization of the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky partial differential equation in \$(1+1)\$ dimensions.},

The magnetic field of the new stellarator is generated by only four planar coils including two interlocking coils of elliptical shape and two circular poloidal field coils. The interlocking coil topology is the same as that of the Columbia Non-neutral Torus (CNT) [Pedersen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 205002 (2002)]. The new configuration was obtained by minimizing the effective helical ripple directly via the shape of the two interlocking coils. The optimized compact stellarator has very low effective ripple in the plasma core, implying excellent neoclassical confinement. This is confirmed by the results of the drift-kinetic code SFINCS [Landreman et al., Phys. Plasmas 21, 042503 (2014)], showing that the particle diffusion coefficient of the new configuration is one order of magnitude lower than CNT’s.},

Conventional approaches assume a toroidal ‘winding’ surface, but a poorly chosen winding surface can unnecessarily constrain the coil optimization algorithm, This article presents a new method to design coils for stellarators. Each discrete coil is represented as an arbitrary, closed, one-dimensional curve embedded in three-dimensional space. A target function to be minimized that includes both physical requirements and engineering constraints is constructed. The derivatives of the target function with respect to the parameters describing the coil geometries and currents are calculated analytically. A numerical code, named flexible optimized coils using space curves (FOCUS), has been developed. Applications to a simple stellarator configuration, W7-X and LHD vacuum fields are presented.},

  abstract = {The presence of error fields has been shown to degrade plasma confinement and drive instabilities. Error fields can arise from many sources, but are predominantly attributed to deviations in the coil geometry. In this paper, we introduce a Hessian matrix approach for determining error field sensitivity to coil deviations. A primary cost function used for designing stellarator coils, the surface integral of normalized normal field errors, was adopted to evaluate the deviation of the generated magnetic field from the desired magnetic field. The FOCUS code (Zhu et al 2018 Nucl. Fusion 58 016008) is utilized to provide fast and accurate calculations of the Hessian. The sensitivities of error fields to coil displacements are then determined by the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. A proof-of-principle example is given on a CNT-like configuration. We anticipate that this new method could provide information to avoid dominant coil misalignments and simplify coil designs for stellarators.},

  abstract = {To find the optimal coils for stellarators, nonlinear optimization algorithms are applied in existing coil design codes. However, none of these codes have used the information from the second-order derivatives. In this paper, we present a modified Newton method in the recently developed code FOCUS. The Hessian matrix is calculated with analytically derived equations. Its inverse is approximated by a modified Cholesky factorization and applied in the iterative scheme of a classical Newton method. Using this method, FOCUS is able to recover the W7-X modular coils starting from a simple initial guess. Results demonstrate significant advantages.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a simple, flexible, and efficient algorithm for constructing a possibly non-convex, simple polygon that characterizes the shape of a set of input points in the plane, termed a characteristic shape. The algorithm is based on the Delaunay triangulation of the points. The shape produced by the algorithm is controlled by a single normalized parameter, which can be used to generate a finite, totally ordered family of related characteristic shapes, varying between the convex hull at one extreme and a uniquely defined shape with minimum area. An optimal O(nlogn) algorithm for computing the shapes is presented. Characteristic shapes possess a number of desirable properties, and the paper includes an empirical investigation of the shapes produced by the algorithm. This investigation provides experimental evidence that with appropriate parameterization the algorithm is able to accurately characterize the shape of a wide range of different point distributions and densities. The experiments detail the effects of changing parameter values and provide an indication of some “good” parameter values to use in certain circumstances.},

  abstract = {Permanent magnets provide a possible solution to simplify complicated stellarator coils. A prototype permanent magnet stellarator structure, PM4Stell, has been funded to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using permanent magnets to create the shaping field of a stellarator. Permanent magnets in uniform cubes with three polarization directions will be carefully placed to generate the required magnetic field for a National Compact Stellarator eXperiment-like equilibrium together with planar toroidal field coils. Discrete magnets will be glued together and inserted into a “post-office-box-like” supporting structure. Electromagnetic and structural analyses have been done to validate the design. Error field correction magnets will be used to shim possible error fields. The design efforts of the prototype permanent magnet stellarator structure are discussed.},
